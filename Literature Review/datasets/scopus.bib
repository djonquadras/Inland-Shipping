	abstract = {River transport of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to the ocean is a crucial but poorly quantified regional carbon cycle component. Large uncertainties remaining on the riverine DOC export from China, as well as its trend and drivers of change, have challenged the reconciliation between atmosphere-based and land-based estimates of China's land carbon sink. Here, we harmonized a large database of riverine in-situ measurements and applied a random forest model, to quantify riverine DOC fluxes (FDOC) and DOC concentrations (CDOC) in rivers across China. This study proposes the first DOC modeling effort capable of reproducing well the magnitude of riverine CDOC and FDOC, as well as its trends, on a monthly scale and with a much wider spatial distribution over China compared to previous studies that mainly focused on annual-scale estimates and large rivers. Results show that over the period 2001–2015, the average CDOC was 2.25 ± 0.45 mg/L and average FDOC was 4.04 ± 1.02 Tg/year. Simultaneously, we found a significant increase in FDOC (+0.044 Tg/year2, p =.01), but little change in CDOC (−0.001 mg/L/year, p >.10). Although the trend in CDOC is not significant at the country scale, it is significantly increasing in the Yangtze River Basin and Huaihe River Basin (0.005 and 0.013 mg/L/year, p <.05) while significantly decreasing in the Yellow River Basin and Southwest Rivers Basin (−0.043 and −0.014 mg/L/year, p =.01). Changes in hydrology, play a stronger role than direct impacts of anthropogenic activities in determining the spatio-temporal variability of FDOC and CDOC across China. However, and in contrast with other basins, the significant increase in CDOC in the Yangtze River Basin and Huaihe River Basin is attributable to direct anthropogenic activities. Given the dominance of hydrology in driving FDOC, the increase in FDOC is likely to continue under the projected increase in river discharge over China resulting from a future wetter climate. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {At the European scale, inland navigation waterway transport is considered as a competitive and environment friendly alternative to road and rail transport. This transport mode is promoting in north of France thanks to the building of the Canal Seine-Nord. The number of boats and the navigation scheduling will increase significantly. A big raise of the required water volume is waited. Overcoming this future navigation demand will be particularly challenging in a climate change context. Hence, a crucial step consists in investigating the resilience of the inland navigation networks considering the future navigation demand and the climate change impacts. The main objective of this paper is to present the tools dedicated to the resilience determination that is required to design adaptive management strategies of these networks. An integrated model is proposed to model the network and to identify and quantify water supplies and water intakes. Then, a generalized flow-based network is used to model the water volume dispatching. The water dispatching has to be optimized according to the network resilience against the increase of navigation demand, and against the decrease of available water resource particularly during drought periods. Due to the complex structure of the networks, uncertainties that are linked to the daily number of boat and to the available water resource, an interesting approach will consist in defining a distributed problem. Local virtual agents will be designed to manage each waterway section, and a global coordination process will guarantee the efficient management of the network. The tools are designed and tested considering the inland navigation network in north of France. © 2016 The Authors.},

	abstract = {A study of water transport in a high temperature phosphoric acid doped polybenzimidazole (PBI) membrane fuel cell stack is reported. Tests with different stoichiometries of dry cathode and different humidity levels of anode are performed. It is found that water transport across the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) is noteworthy and that water vapor partial pressure on the anode outlet is almost always higher than on the cathode outlet, even when using dry hydrogen. The water transport is a strong function of current density but it also depends on stoichiometry and humidity level. In a series of tests with dry nitrogen on one side and humid nitrogen on the other side, the membrane's water permeability coefficient is determined to be 2.4 × 10-13 mol s-1 cm-1 Pa-1 at 160 °C which is more than an order of magnitude higher than the values previously reported in the literature. Also, the results indicate that the permeability coefficient might be relative humidity dependent and could even be somewhat higher than the value reported here, but further investigation is needed. The experimental findings are reproduced and explained with a 2D steady state computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. Internal water transport profiles across the membrane and along the gas flow channels are presented and discussed. © 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Inland waterway transport is now playing a significant role thanks to its various advantages over the other transportation modes, for example, low cost, low environmental pollution, and large capacity, etc. However, inland waterways are not only naturally curved but also narrow and shallow, which causes complex flow environments and navigational conditions. Inland ships are consequently susceptible to accidents in restricted curved waterways. Especially during these years, this mode of transport has seen significant progress by the arrival of the new generation of ships (larger size and more powerful), and this makes ships' maneuverability in such sensitive waters severer. The aim of the present work is firstly to well understand the flow behaviors around a ship in bending zones, and secondly to study the variation of hydrodynamic forces (bank cushion and suction phenomena) in these zones. To conduct this investigation, the CFD model based on an unsteady Navier-Stokes solver in STARCCM+ is used. The verification and validation of this model are realized by respecting the ITTC recommendations. The latter is then used to perform a series of simulations by testing the following parameters: channel angle, water depth to draft ratio, ship speed, channel bottom width and drift angle on ship hydrodynamics in restricted curved fairways. The obtained results of this work provide an interesting idea about the ship's hydrodynamics variation and characterize the parameters that seriously impact the ship controllability in restricted bending channels. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In 2005, it was estimated that over 70% of oil spills in Colombia affected riverine areas. The Magdalena River is the longest navigable river in the country. It is home to countless species of flora and fauna, and provides important services as both a resource and a river transport route. Hydrocarbons represent 91% of products carried on the river. Mitigation associated with oil spill impacts depends largely on the formulation and implementation of adequate contingency plans, which should incorporate the identification of sources of oil spills, the simulation of the respective dispersion patterns and the characterization of areas that could be affected by a spill. Several different types of oil spills in the Magdalena River were simulated in order to assess the possible spill behavior, based on an analysis of sites at risk of releasing oil into the water stream, and considering the characteristics of the products most frequently transported along the river or used as fuel for boats. Taking into account the seasonal variability in river level and river flow, two different scenarios were simulated: rainy season (which usually floods in the surrounding area of the river) and normal season (when the river is within its usual margins and is navigable on most of its reaches); the dry season was not simulated at the time of this paper because of missing shoreline information. The results show considerable differences in the behaviour of the spilled oil under different climatic seasons. Therefore, this type of analysis is suitable to use for the formulation of refined plans for effective and efficient spill response and mitigation. © Copyright 2017, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.},

In case of inland waterway transportation (IWT), once vessels have to operate close to urban areas or in natural reserves, the necessity to provide a'green navigation' is of primary importance. With this specific aim, especially for small crafts, the adoption of an hybrid-electric power system grant a significant pollution reduction, leading also to a possible Zero Emission Mode (ZEM) navigation. However, the particular configuration of inland waterways makes the estimation of vessels' hydrodynamic performances harder compared to a seagoing ship, because of restricted waters effects, affecting both resistance and manoeuvring characteristics. For this purpose, time domain simulation program has been developed to estimate the effective power demand of an inland vessel during a specific route. The program has been tested on the specific case of a passenger vessel designed for the Grado lagoon, where all the reference route bathymetric data were available. By means of the simulations it has been possible to state whether the vessel is suitable to operate in ZEM mode during the service. © 2018 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This report presents the results of research regarding strategic freight transport network modelling in Colombia using external cost. The model uses sequential equilibrium between distribution and traffic assignment phases; it is national and inter-regional, involving strategic decisionmaking. The Colombian transport network consists of 27,469 km of roads, 11,257 km of navigable rivers, 2,192 km of railway lines and a set of centroid connectors for establishing a link with the zoning system (consisting of 70 internal areas and 8 external areas). Each link in a network involves internal costs: time, operation and external costs, congestion, accidents, air pollution and CO2 emissions. Vehicle ownership costs were excluded from internal cost analysis; costs such as noise, climate change and effects on the landscape were not studied in external costs. Marginal costs regarding the network were estimated by two methods. First, it was assumed that an additional unit of demand did not affect equilibrium in a transport network and then marginal cost was estimated as being the sum of marginal costs regarding links in the shortest path. The other approach assumed that an additional unit of demand changed network equilibrium; marginal costs were then estimated by calculating the difference between the two equilibrium scenarios. The methods were applied to 7 selected routes covering the most important Colombian freight transport corridors. An average 0.014 US$/ton/km rate was estimated for external costs regarding highway transport, 0.000105 US$/ton/km for water transport and 0.001625 US$/ton/km for railroad transport (preponderance of environmental costs exceeding 90%).},

	abstract = {This work documents the first version of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) new Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SMv1). We focus on the standard resolution of the fully coupled physical model designed to address DOE mission-relevant water cycle questions. Its components include atmosphere and land (110-km grid spacing), ocean and sea ice (60 km in the midlatitudes and 30 km at the equator and poles), and river transport (55 km) models. This base configuration will also serve as a foundation for additional configurations exploring higher horizontal resolution as well as augmented capabilities in the form of biogeochemistry and cryosphere configurations. The performance of E3SMv1 is evaluated by means of a standard set of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Characterization of Klima simulations consisting of a long preindustrial control, historical simulations (ensembles of fully coupled and prescribed SSTs) as well as idealized CO2 forcing simulations. The model performs well overall with biases typical of other CMIP-class models, although the simulated Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is weaker than many CMIP-class models. While the E3SMv1 historical ensemble captures the bulk of the observed warming between preindustrial (1850) and present day, the trajectory of the warming diverges from observations in the second half of the twentieth century with a period of delayed warming followed by an excessive warming trend. Using a two-layer energy balance model, we attribute this divergence to the model's strong aerosol-related effective radiative forcing (ERFari+aci = −1.65 W/m2) and high equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS = 5.3 K). © 2019.

	abstract = {The Community Land Model (CLM) is the land component of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and is used in several global and regional modeling systems. In this paper, we introduce model developments included in CLM version 5 (CLM5), which is the default land component for CESM2. We assess an ensemble of simulations, including prescribed and prognostic vegetation state, multiple forcing data sets, and CLM4, CLM4.5, and CLM5, against a range of metrics including from the International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMBv2) package. CLM5 includes new and updated processes and parameterizations: (1) dynamic land units, (2) updated parameterizations and structure for hydrology and snow (spatially explicit soil depth, dry surface layer, revised groundwater scheme, revised canopy interception and canopy snow processes, updated fresh snow density, simple firn model, and Model for Scale Adaptive River Transport), (3) plant hydraulics and hydraulic redistribution, (4) revised nitrogen cycling (flexible leaf stoichiometry, leaf N optimization for photosynthesis, and carbon costs for plant nitrogen uptake), (5) global crop model with six crop types and time-evolving irrigated areas and fertilization rates, (6) updated urban building energy, (7) carbon isotopes, and (8) updated stomatal physiology. New optional features include demographically structured dynamic vegetation model (Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator), ozone damage to plants, and fire trace gas emissions coupling to the atmosphere. Conclusive establishment of improvement or degradation of individual variables or metrics is challenged by forcing uncertainty, parametric uncertainty, and model structural complexity, but the multivariate metrics presented here suggest a general broad improvement from CLM4 to CLM5. ©2019.

The answer is given to the question: to what extent will the use of different configurations of hybrid systems, affect the reduction of fuel consumption and reduce poisonous gases to the atmosphere? Various configurations of propulsion systems have been proposed: liquefied natural gas (LNG)-Diesel, LNG-Diesel-Electric, LNG-Diesel-Battery-Electric, against the background of the current state of inland waterway transport in central Europe. The announced plans to expand the network of existing international water routes in this region of Europe (E30, E40, E70), prompts a reflection on the simultaneous possibility of building modern low-emission and energy-efficient inland transport vessels. As an example of a modern drive system design, LNG-Diesel-Battery-Electric was proposed for which simulations were carried out using Modelica software. The conducted research has shown the possibility of reducing energy consumption by approximately 13% in relation to the classical drive system with a diesel engine, and reduction of CO2 emissions by approx. 29% with respect to the conventional diesel drive. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The tropical thermocline plays an important role in regulating equatorial sea surface temperature (SST); at present, it is still poorly simulated in the state-of-the-art climate models. In this paper, thermocline biases in the tropical North Pacific are investigated using the newly released CMIP6 historical simulations. It is found that CMIP6 models tend to produce an overly shallow thermocline in the northwestern tropics, accompanied by a deep thermocline in the northeastern tropics. A pronounced thermocline strength bias arises in the tropical northeastern Pacific, demonstrating a dipole structure with a sign change at about 8◦N. These thermocline biases are accompanied with biases in the simulations of oceanic circulations, including a too weak North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC), a reduction in water exchanges between the subtropics and the equatorial regions, and an eastward extension of the equatorward interior water transport. The causes of these thermocline biases are further analyzed. The thermocline bias is primarily caused by the model deficiency in simulating the surface wind stress curl, which can be further attributed to the longstanding double-ITCZ bias in the tropical North Pacific. Besides, thermocline strength bias can be partly attributed to the poor prescription of oceanic background diffusivity. By constraining the diffusivity to match observations, the thermocline strength in the tropical northeastern Pacific is greatly increased. © 2021 American Meteorological Society.

	abstract = {The Palembang City, one of the cities in Indonesia with a high population density, is crossed by the Musi River and its networks that flow through 10 sub districts and 30 villages. The shipping lanes of the Musi River within Palembang City and its suburbs can be navigated by huge ships all year round and are means of transportation that is free from congestion, environmentally friendly and energy efficient. Since 2018, river transport in Palembang is connected with the South Sumatra light rail transit (LRT), namely in the Ampera area. The LRT is a convenient and strategic transportation, because it passes through office, business center, entertainment and sports facilities. In addition, this rail-based transportation is connected with Trans Musi and air transportation. Both of these transportations have affordable and competitive fares comparable to other transportation. However, until now these two transportations are still equally struggling to attract customers. Therefore, this study aimed to determine public perception of transportation connected to the LRT and what they want for the integration between these two modes. Then, the public perceptions were visualized into images or computer simulation. The images or simulation was then re-run by the community to see whether it is what they want or whether it still needs revision or addition. The survey also investigated whether there is an increase in users if the perception is realized. It shows that the most desired supporting facility for the integration between the river transport and the LRT is pedestrian lanes or sidewalks. Furthermore, a more realistic explanation tool will help people to imagine the activities that will be carried out in the future; thus, they are more convinced to choose to use it or not. © 2023, Horizon Research Publishing.

	abstract = {Inland water transportation is regarded as one of the most effective ways for humanity to reduce its carbon footprint. The Sarawak Inland Water Transport System (IWTS) has become an essential tool for its residents due to its geographical location. They have access to basic facilities along the rivers’ tributaries through their water transportation. Currently, undeveloped IWTS in the Rajang River has become a navigation safety issue depending on the type of vessel, with insufficient navigational aid installed in certain areas. The nature of the inadequacy of navigation safety can be daunting as it can lead to loss of life, damage to the environment, disruption of operations, injuries, and a long-term environmental impact, often causing severe consequences. This study assessed navigational safety on the Rajang River and recommended appropriate improvements based on the most recent specification requirements of the International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities (IALA) (IALA, 2009). The 3D area simulation of navigation marks will be developed using Sketch-Up Software based on satellite image data. The data was then analysed using Risk Assessment (Fuzzy-AHP technique) to propose the most appropriate aids for navigation and their placement. The proposal and design of aids in navigation for Tanjung Rajang River will increase safety and security for the shipping industry, increase turnaround time, and help maintain a zeroaccident rate. © Penerbit UMT},

	abstract = {This study describes a source apportionment methodology for nitrogen river transport. A statistical model has been developed to determine the contribution of each source (punctual and diffuse) of nitrogen to river-mouth transport. A non-linear regression equation was developed, relating measured nitrogen transport rates in streams to spatially referenced nitrogen sources and basin characteristics. The model considers applied fertilizer, atmospheric deposition and point discharges as sources, and winter rainfall, average air temperature, topographic wetness index and dry season flow as basin characteristics. The model was calibrated in an area of 8913 km2 in East Anglia (UK). In the studied area, the average contribution of agriculture to the nitrogen load is estimated around 71%. Point sources and atmospheric deposition respectively account for 24% and 5% of the exported nitrogen. The model allowed the estimation of the contribution of each source to nitrogen emissions and the nitrogen retention in soils and waters as influenced by basin factors. © IWA Publishing 2005.},

	abstract = {Vessels sailing in a single platoon could reduce resistance from the perspective of the whole platoon and the individual vessel, and contribute to improving energy benefits. Moreover, transportation energy costs and traffic efficiency are essential indicators for measuring waterborne transportation systems. We attempt to minimize transportation energy costs by coordinating platoon formation using a distributed framework of controllers. A large-scale coordinated vessel platooning program is proposed to minimize transportation energy costs and optimize traffic efficiency while guaranteeing safety. The control framework covers routing, energy consumption-dependent cooperative platooning decision and speed optimization based on graph search algorithm, cluster analysis, optimal control approach and model predictive control. Firstly, a local scheduling strategy combined with the leader vessel selection algorithm is adopted. Furthermore, we used cluster analysis to create a series of mergeable vessel platooning sets. Then, we used the mathematical planning method and a two-step hybrid optimal control approach to calculate the improvement and optimization of each vessel platoon&#x2019;s path and speed. Finally, the scalability of the scheduling strategy is elucidated. In a simulation of large scale inland waterborne network, savings surpassed 3.5% when six hundreds vessels participated in the system. These simulation results reveal that the scheduling strategy coordinating vessels into vessel platooning, which improves transportation efficiency as well as descends cost, comparing to a fixed origin route in the waterway network.

	abstract = {Purpose: In recent years intermodal transport has received an increased attention due to problems of road congestion, environmental concerns and traffic safety. A growing recognition of the external effects of transport urges to go towards more sustainable transport modes. As a consequence, research and policy interest in intermodal freight transportation problems is growing. Methods: In this paper the strengths of Operations Research (OR) modelling techniques applicable to decisions related to intermodal transport are used to develop a particular framework that is able to assess the performance of current and potential policy measures which affects the intermodal transport industry. The assessment framework includes three core models necessary to evaluate all relevant transport modes and aggregation levels. Results: In the last section of the paper, the assessment framework is applied to a case study related to the location of a new intermodal barge terminal for which the optimal location is searched, the market area is analysed and the impact on the performance of the network is discussed. © 2011 The Author(s).},

Therefore, the present work aims to present a strategy for forecasting the daily water flow of the Zambezi River in the Cahora Bassa dam, located in Mozambique, an important energy producer in the country and the fourth largest dam in Africa. Historical rainfall, evaporation, and humidity records collected from 2003 to 2011 are used for training and testing a model that forecasts water flow using the Group Method of Data Handling algorithm. The results achieved were compared, through error metrics, with those of other models to prove the effectiveness of the assembled model. They revealed that the proposed model achieves a satisfactory performance for the forecast horizon and could become a helpful tool in monitoring hydrographic basins and forecasting their daily streamflow values. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Institute of Geophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences & Polish Academy of Sciences.},

	abstract = {The implications of climate change and other human perturbations on the oceanic carbon cycle are still associated with large uncertainties. Global-scale modelling studies are essential to investigate anthropogenic perturbations of oceanic carbon fluxes but, until now, they have not considered the impacts of temporal changes in riverine and atmospheric inputs of P and N on the marine net biological productivity (NPP) and air–sea CO2 exchange (FCO2). To address this, we perform a series of simulations using an enhanced version of the global ocean biogeochemistry model HAMOCC to isolate effects arising from (1) increasing atmospheric CO2 levels, (2) a changing physical climate and (3) alterations in inputs of terrigenous P and N on marine carbon cycling over the 1905–2010 period. Our simulations reveal that our first-order approximation of increased terrigenous nutrient inputs causes an enhancement of 2.15 Pg C year−1 of the global marine NPP, a relative increase of +5% over the simulation period. This increase completely compensates the simulated NPP decrease as a result of increased upper ocean stratification of −3% in relative terms. The coastal ocean undergoes a global relative increase of 14% in NPP arising largely from increased riverine inputs, with regional increases exceeding 100%, for instance on the shelves of the Bay of Bengal. The imprint of enhanced terrigenous nutrient inputs is also simulated further offshore, inducing a 1.75 Pg C year−1 (+4%) enhancement of the NPP in the open ocean. This finding implies that the perturbation of carbon fluxes through coastal eutrophication may extend further offshore than that was previously assumed. While increased nutrient inputs are the largest driver of change for the CO2 uptake at the regional scale and enhance the global coastal ocean CO2 uptake by 0.02 Pg C year−1, they only marginally affect the FCO2 of the open ocean over our study's timeline. © 2021 The Authors.

Identifying carbon emission sources and estimating carbon emissions from multiple perspectives form the basis for scientifically proposing low-carbon pathways for inland shipping. Carbon footprint assessment models for inland ships were developed from both micro and macro perspectives to assess the carbon emissions of individual ships and fleets. An inland diesel-powered ship was taken as an example to analyse the carbon footprint of LNG (liquid nature gas) and methanol as alternative fuels, and the uncertainty and economy were analysed. The carbon emissions from China's inland shipping in 2019–2020 were studied using an improved turnover method, and the carbon intensities of inland passenger and freight transportation were analysed. Finally, low-carbon pathways for inland shipping were proposed. The results show that the CO2-eq of the LNG scheme was 6.83% and 53.99% less than that of diesel and coal-based methanol, respectively, making it a suitable fuel alternative for ships. CO2 emissions from inland shipping reached 20.924 million tons in 2019, followed by a 0.98% reduction by 2020. The carbon intensity of freight transportation was less than that of passenger transportation; however, the energy consumption carbon intensities of both were approximately equal. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Copper-containing antifouling paints (AFP) are widely used for leisure boat maintenance. Cu emitted from AFP into German surface water bodies has been suggested to be a significant source of heavy metal pollution, threatening water quality. We developed two scenarios to model Cu emissions from AFP applied on leisure boats on national scale, which allow identifying regional hotspots. The top-down approach (scenario A) was based on a previous study on national AFP consumption, while in the bottom-up approach (scenario B), median and interquartile range of Cu release rates depending on salinity conditions were considered for emission estimation. Both scenarios clearly highlighted the locally high emission pressure on inland waters in popular watersport regions, identifying these as requiring intense protection. Scenario B generally predicted lower Cu emissions (sea: 11.05–25.53 t a−1, inland: 14.15–34.59 t a−1) than scenario A (sea: 22.53 t a−1, inland: 47.97 t a−1). To evaluate their relevance, scenario results were compared to emissions modelled with MoRE (Modelling of Regionalized Emissions), which is used as reporting tool on substance emissions by Germany. According to scenarios A and B, the emission from AFP accounted for 13 % and 4–9 % of the total Cu emissions into inland waters in 2016, respectively. Scenario results were similar or higher than other emission pathways such as industrial direct dischargers. Thus, we consider Cu emissions from AFP as a significant pathway to be included in the MoRE emission inventory. We recommend scenario B for implementation as it allows a more flexible adaptation for future modelling. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In the context of the environmental improvement of inland shipping, this paper studies the interaction mechanism of tripartite behavioral strategy selection among the upstream and downstream governments and shipping companies in neighboring provinces. This paper constructs a tripartite evolutionary game model that introduces the prospect theory, and verifies numerical examples in combination with system dynamics simulation methods. Therefore, this study discusses the influence of evolutionary stability strategies on the development of electric ship industry. The results show that in order to realize effective governance of inland shipping pollution, the optimal evolutionary stability strategies of the three stakeholders should be as follows: active supervision in both upstream and downstream governments, and using clean energy in shipping companies. The improvement of the initial probability and risk preference of the three parties is conducive to promoting the faster and more stable industrial development, while reasonable profit distribution coefficient and compensation cost can promote the benign development of the inland river environmental governance system. In addition, the probability of upstream and downstream governments and shipping companies choosing the optimal strategies is positively related to the government fines, and negatively related to the regulatory costs. In particular, the application of prospect theory makes the result of evolutionary equilibrium more obvious. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In this paper, an adaptive and predictive control architecture is proposed to improve the management of inland navigation networks in a global change context. This architecture aims at ensuring the seaworthiness conditions of inland navigation networks, and to improve the efficiency of the water resource management. It is based on supervision and prognosis modules which allow the estimation of the current state of the network, and the forecasting of the extreme event occurrence. According to these indicators and to the management constraints and objectives, control strategies of the inland navigation networks will be adapted to limit the impacts of the extreme events. To achieve this aim, three challenges are considered and discussed in this paper. The first one consists in proposing an accurate modeling approach of navigation reaches which are characterized by large scale, nonlinearities, time delays, unknown inputs and outputs, etc. The second one is to increase the knowledge about potentiality of extreme events, consequences of the climate change. The prediction of these events is rather complex due to their rarity, the spacio-temporal scale of the networks, etc. Finally, the third one is the pooling of the two first contributions, i.e. the model of the system and the knowledge about extreme events. Thus, the resilience of the system and the adaptation of the management strategies could be realized. © IFAC.},

	abstract = {This study proposes a method to simulate the images of the future European geostationary sensor dedicated to ocean color sensor: the geostationary ocean color advanced permanent imager (GeoOCAPI), and it demonstrates the sensor capabilities to monitor the water composition throughout the day. The temporal variation of the coastal seascape is obtained from biogeochemical and hydrosedimentary models, the ocean-atmosphere radiance is obtained from the water and atmosphere radiative transfer model. The GeoOCAPI images are simulated with 400-m resolution, 18 spectral bands with associated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and with 1-h acquisition frequency, on the Gulf of Lion (Marseille, France) during a pollution event caused by the urban outfall of Cortiou in Marseille. These images describe the water color dynamic in the Gulf of Lion due to the river transport and the urban outfall. The validation with real medium resolution imaging spectrometer (MERIS) images showed that the image simulator was reliable with an average relative error (RE) at 4.76% for visible bands and at 16.51% for near infrared bands. The quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) inversion method was tested. The suspended particulate matter (SPM) and the colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) can be retrieved with good accuracy; the error is, respectively, 7.69% and 12.21%. The chlorophyll concentration (chl) is misestimated (58.10%) due to the low concentration in this area (< 1 mg - m-3) compared to SPM (> 1 g - m-3). The study showed that the future geostationary sensor GeoOCAPI will be able to monitor the water composition in coastal areas through the day and detect and monitor an urban outfall discharge. © 2008-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Over the past few decades, numerous geochemical and geological observations of early Mars have suggested the presence of surface river systems during the late Noachian and early Hesperian. A large volume of liquid water combined with stable and long-term fluvial activity is required to explain these river systems, suggesting that early Mars must have experienced a long period during which the climate was sufficiently warm and wet for stable surface liquid water and precipitation to occur. We performed 3-dimensional climate simulations for the late Noachian and early Hesperian using a paleo-Mars global climate model (PMGCM), assuming a CO2/H2O/H2 atmosphere under the “Faint Young Sun” condition and using the assumed topography before the formation of the Tharsis load. Cases of surface pressures of up to 2 bar and obliquities of 20°, 40°, and 60° were investigated. We also developed a river transport model, CRIS (Catchment-based RIver Simulator), which enabled us to estimate global river discharge and the transport of bedload and suspended load sediments from the PMGCM output for a variety of sediment particle sizes. Our simulation results revealed that CO2 atmospheres with surface pressures of above 2 bar and a few percent of H2 composition produced a hospitable surface environment that could support the stable liquid water on the surface for long periods. Annual precipitation increased with surface pressure, and intense precipitation occurred around the low to mid-latitudes, where the majority of the valley networks are currently observed. Our river model CRIS produced river runoff, which agrees with some parts of the observed valley distribution, and revealed that these valleys could be formed in ~104 years, which agrees with previous geological studies. However, our simulation results also suggested that Martian valleys were not all created as a result of precipitation-fed river activity, and other mechanisms such as seasonal or transient snow melting should be simultaneously considered to explain Martian valley networks. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The Three Gorges Dam (TGD) is the world's largest hydropower construction. It can significantly impact contaminant transport in the Yangtze River–East China Sea Continuum (YR–ECSC). In addition to evaluating the impact of the TGD on the deposition of contaminants in the reservoir, we also address their cycles in the river below the dam and in the coastal East China Sea. A comprehensive study of metal contaminant transport along the YR–ECSC has not been previously attempted. We quantified the fates of mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd) and chromium (Cr) within the YR–ECSC, and the impacts of the TGD, by sampling water and suspended particles along the Yangtze River during spring, summer, fall, and winter and by modeling. We found that the Yangtze River transports substantial amounts of heavy metals into the coastal ocean. In 2016, riverine transport amounted to 48, 5900, 11,000, 230, and 15,000 megagrams (Mg) for Hg, As, Pb, Cd, and Cr, respectively, while other terrestrial contributions were negligible. Metal flux into the coastal ocean was primarily derived from the downstream portion of the river (84–97%), while metals transported from upstream were largely trapped in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR, 72%–96%). For example, 34 Mg of Hg accumulated in the TGR owing to river damming, large-scale soil erosion, and anthropogenic point source releases, while 21 Mg of Hg was depleted from the riverbed downstream owing to the altered river hydrology caused by the TGD. Overall the construction of TGD resulted in a 6.9% net decrease in the Hg burden of the East China Sea, compared to the pre-TGD period. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

River management of the main Dutch Rhine branch, the Waal River, aims at improving navigation conditions, at the same time taking into account other, sometimes conflicting interests. Therefore integrated approaches are demanded to implement improvement measures. This paper focuses on the river improvement measures, executed in the Waal River for the benefit of navigation since 1995. The impact of executed and planned measures for navigation on the morphology of the river is discussed. New in the approach since 1995 is that in addition to (essentially traditional) permanent bend improvement measures, recurrent measures like (systematic) dredging and sediment feeding schemes are becoming increasingly important. This signals a change in policy of the Dutch Public Works Department, which traditionally preferred permanent fixed solutions. Special emphasis is given to the specific in-depth field and mathematical modelling studies, which were carried out to understand the morphological processes in this engineered river, the interaction between structures and the river and the relevant time and spatial scales of effects and impacts of the recurrent methods. The need for a master plan taking into account the autonomic trends to facilitate a sustainable development of the river system is underlined. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Despite several national and local policies towards cleaner air in England, many schools in London breach the WHO-recommended concentrations of air pollutants such as NO2 and PM2.5. This is while, previous studies highlight significant adverse health effects of air pollutants on children's health. In this paper we adopted a Bayesian spatial hierarchical model to investigate factors that affect the odds of schools exceeding the WHO-recommended concentration of NO2 (i.e., 40 μg/m3 annual mean) in Greater London (UK). We considered a host of variables including schools' characteristics as well as their neighbourhoods' attributes from household, socioeconomic, transport-related, land use, built and natural environment characteristics perspectives. The results indicated that transport-related factors including the number of traffic lights and bus stops in the immediate vicinity of schools, and borough-level bus fuel consumption are determinant factors that increase the likelihood of non-compliance with the WHO guideline. In contrast, distance from roads, river transport, and underground stations, vehicle speed (an indicator of traffic congestion), the proportion of borough-level green space, and the area of green space at schools reduce the likelihood of exceeding the WHO recommended concentration of NO2. We repeated our analysis under a hypothetical scenario in which the recommended concentration of NO2 is 35 μg/m3 – instead of 40 μg/m3. Our results underscore the importance of adopting clean fuel technologies on buses, installing green barriers, and reducing motorised traffic around schools in reducing exposure to NO2 concentrations in proximity to schools. Also, our findings highlight the presence of environmental inequalities in the Greater London area. This study would be useful for local authority decision making with the aim of improving air quality for school-aged children in urban settings. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Plastic pollution in the marine environment is an urgent global environmental challenge. Land-based plastics, emitted into the ocean through rivers, are believed to be the main source of marine plastic litter. According to the latest model-based estimates, most riverine plastics are emitted in Asia. However, the exact amount of global riverine plastic emission remains uncertain due to a severe lack of observation. Field-based studies are rare in numbers, focused on rivers in Europe and North America and used strongly varying data collection methods. We present a harmonized assessment of floating macroplastic transport from observations at 24 locations in rivers in seven countries in Europe and Asia. Visual counting and debris sampling were used to assess (1) magnitude of plastic transport, (2) the spatial distribution across the river width, and (3) the plastic polymer composition. Several waterways in Indonesia and Vietnam contain up to four orders of magnitude more plastic than waterways in Italy, France, and The Netherlands in terms of plastic items per hour. We present a first transcontinental overview of plastic transport, providing observational evidence that, for the sampled rivers, Asian rivers transport considerably more plastics towards the ocean. New insights are presented in the magnitude, composition, and spatiotemporal variation of riverine plastic debris. We emphasize the urgent need for more long-term monitoring efforts. Accurate data on riverine plastic debris are extremely important to improve global and local modeling approaches and to optimize prevention and collection strategies. © 2019 The Author(s).

	abstract = {As with other emerging economies, the rapid economic development of Indonesia has led to a migration towards the cities. The coastal megacity Jakarta is one of the largest urban agglomerations worldwide. The uncontrolled increase in urban population results in increased pressure on public infrastructure such as sewage treatment facilities leading to severe pollution of surface waters. In this study, a mass flux approach was used to assess the transport of organic pollutants by the largest city bound river of Jakarta, the Ciliwung, into the adjacent coastal ecosystem. Mass flux approaches are useful to track the origin and transport of wastewater-borne pollution, but are mostly neglected in favor of solely concentration-based evaluations. Constituents of municipal sewage made up around 70–80% of the fluxes of the 32 quantified water pollutants. Personal care product ingredients, especially the insect repellent N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), exhibited the highest fluxes. Our first assessment revealed that the Ciliwung River transports around 5–17 tons year−1 of the quantified pollutants into the Java Sea. Such huge pollutant fluxes from municipal sources -a problem that is also relevant in other coastal megacities-might severely affect vulnerable coastal habitats. © 2018},

	abstract = {In a global change context, governments in Europe want to promote alternative transports as inland navigation or railway instead of road transport. As example, in north of France, a shift of 20% from road transport to these alternative transport solutions is expected by 2050. Reaching this goal requires not only the delivery of new infrastructures and equipment, but also the design of efficient management strategies. By focusing on waterborne transport, it is thus necessary to improve the management of the inland navigation networks particularly the water resource. Indeed, the waterborne transport accommodation is strongly linked to the available water resource. This will be a challenging point in a global change context. The paper deals with the global change impacts on inland navigation networks. It aims at proposing new contributions as compared to past and current results of European projects on climate change and inland navigation. It appeared that the multi-scale modeling approach for inland navigation networks that was proposed during the last TRA Conference in Paris in 2014 is useful to determine the resilience of these networks and their ability to guarantee the navigation conditions during drought and flood periods. The proposed tools are developed to consider two space and time scales. The first approach is used to determine the water quantity that is necessary to accommodate the navigation during half a day, and the second allows the efficient control of the gates to keep the water level of each navigation reach close to its setpoint by rejecting disturbances and compensating the waves due to the lock operations. One example based on the real inland navigation network of the north of France is used to highlight the contributions of the multi-scale modeling approach. © 2016 The Authors.},

This study aims to evaluate the global application of a recently developed Model for Scale Adaptive River Transport (MOSART)coupled with theCommunity Land Model, version 4 (CLM4). To support the global implementation of MOSART, a comprehensive global hydrography dataset has been derived at multiple resolutions from different sources. The simulated runofffields are first evaluated against the composite runoffmap from theGlobal RunoffData Centre (GRDC). The simulated streamflow is then shown to reproduce reasonably well the observed daily andmonthly streamflow at over 1600 of the world'smajor river stations in terms of annual, seasonal, and daily flow statistics. The impacts of model structure complexity are evaluated, and results show that the spatial and temporal variability of river velocity simulated byMOSART is necessary for capturing streamflow seasonality and annual maximum flood. Other sources of the simulation bias include uncertainties in the atmospheric forcing, as revealed by simulations driven by four different climate datasets, and human influences, based on a classification framework that quantifies the impact levels of large dams on the streamflow worldwide. © 2015 American Meteorological Society.},

Combinations of all-weather and winter roads are used in the winter months, while river barge transport and all-weather roads are used in the summer. However, Northern Canada is disproportionately impacted by climate change, which results in greater variability in water level conditions on the Mackenzie River from year to year. This in turn critically affects tug-and-barge operations on the river. This paper investigates Mackenzie River Corridor freight delivery performance – with a focus on the river route – considering how variations in river water conditions can impact network operations and operational costs. We investigate the impacts of water level variation on shippers' route choice decisions, waterway supply capacity and the resulting overall performance of the freight transport system. Model outcomes provide insights into how the multimodal transportation network may be utilized and perform (quantified by delays and generalized costs) under different water level scenarios. The overarching purpose of the analysis is to provide guidance for infrastructure investment decision-making and business case development, to maintain an effective freight transportation network in the face of on-going climate change impacts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In the Amazon Basin, floodplain inundation is a key component of surface water dynamics and plays an important role in water, energy and carbon cycles. The Model for Scale Adaptive River Transport (MOSART) was extended with a macroscale inundation scheme for representing floodplain inundation. The extended model, named MOSART-Inundation, was used to simulate surface hydrology of the entire Amazon Basin. Previous hydrologic modeling studies in the Amazon Basin identified and addressed a few challenges in simulating surface hydrology of this basin, including uncertainties of floodplain topography and channel geometry, and the representation of river flow in reaches with mild slopes. This study further addressed four aspects of these challenges. First, the spatial variability of vegetation-caused biases embedded in the HydroSHEDS digital elevation model (DEM) data was explicitly addressed. A vegetation height map of about 1 km resolution and a land cover dataset of about 90 m resolution were used in a DEM correction procedure that resulted in an average elevation reduction of 13.2m for the entire basin and led to evident changes in the floodplain topography. Second, basin-wide empirical formulae for channel cross-sectional dimensions were refined for various subregions to improve the representation of spatial variability in channel geometry. Third, the channel Manning roughness coefficient was allowed to vary with the channel depth, as the effect of riverbed resistance on river flow generally declines with increasing river size. Lastly, backwater effects were accounted for to better represent river flow in mild-slope reaches. The model was evaluated against in situ streamflow records and remotely sensed Envisat altimetry data and Global Inundation Extent from Multi-Satellites (GIEMS) inundation data. In a sensitivity study, seven simulations were compared to evaluate the impacts of the five modeling aspects addressed in this study. The comparisons showed that representing floodplain inundation could significantly improve the simulated streamflow and river stages. Refining floodplain topography, channel geometry and Manning roughness coefficients, as well as accounting for backwater effects had notable impacts on the simulated surface water dynamics in the Amazon Basin. The understanding obtained in this study could be helpful in improving modeling of surface hydrology in basins with evident inundation, especially at regional to continental scales. © Author(s) 2017.},

In the present project a scenarios study was carried out in which physical modelling has been combined with socio-cultural theory. The focus of the study was on flood risk management. Existing climate, land use and socio-economic scenarios, as well as water management strategies have been structured using the Perspectives method. This resulted in integrated scenarios for water management, each representing a different view of the future, together with the corresponding water management style. These were put in a scenario matrix with combinations of world views and management styles, where these both match and mis-match. Using a suite of existing modelling tools the implications of each scenario for the water systems were evaluated. Finally, a comparison of different water management styles under different possible futures was made, showing the risk, cost and benefits of different strategies. The scenario analyses demonstrates that-at the scale of the entire Rhine basin-the influence of climate changes on extreme floods is much stronger than the influence of land use changes. Flood risk management in the lower river deltas should not fully rely on flood mitigation measures in the upstream basin. It also becomes clear that no flood risk management strategy is superior in all respects and in all circumstances and that safety versus societal costs is really a policy dilemma: win-win situations cannot always be attained. Under changing climate conditions, the present-day type of management in the lower river reaches runs the risk of becoming an expensive attempt to fully control flood risk problems, while trying to avoid real choices, without actually solving the problems in a long-term view. © 2004 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Inland navigation is of increasing economic and ecological interest, however its contribution to environmental quality is hardly known. We hypothesized that i) inland navigation emits considerable amounts of soot-Black Carbon (BC) as a product of incomplete combustion of diesel fuel, which is then deposited on soils along river valleys, that ii) improvement of fuel quality by sulfur reduction in 2011 decreased BC inputs to soil, and that iii) this provides a tracer for the spatial impact of inland navigation emissions. The spatial and temporal patterns of soil BC deposits from inland navigation were investigated yearly (2010-2013) working within transects perpendicular to the rivers Rhine, Moselle and Ahr, Germany (the Ahr Valley is free of shipping and served as a reference). In rural areas at inland waterways navigation likely represented the dominant BC emitter. Topsoils (0-10 cm depth) were sampled in vineyards. Their BC content and composition was determined via oxidation of bulk soil organic matter to benzene polycarboxylic acids (BPCAs). The highly trafficked Rhine Valley yielded only little more BC (64.7 ± 12 g BC kg-1 soil organic carbon (SOC) compared to 51.7 ± 9 at the Moselle, and 53.6 ± 6 at the reference Ahr Valley). At both inland waterways soil BC increased towards the river, following the simulated dispersal of ship-derived BC using a Lagrangian model. In the course of ship fuel regulation, soil BC deposits at the Rhine and Moselle waterways decreased significantly from 70.2 ± 3.2 to 47.9 ± 1.1 and 57.6 ± 1.3 to 41.7 ± 0.9 g BC kg-1 SOC within 3 years. Even more pronounced was the change in BC composition, i.e., the ratio of pentacarboxylated to mellitic acid increased from 0.75 to 1.3 (Rhine) and 1 to 1.4 (Moselle) during this time span. From this we calculated that ~30% less BC was deposited by inland navigation likely due to reduced BC emissions after sulfur regulation in ship diesel. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Floodplain inundation links river and land systems through significant water, sediment, and nutrient exchanges. However, these two-way interactions between land and river are currently missing in most Earth System Models. In this study, we introduced the two-way hydrological coupling between the land component, E3SM Land Model, and the river component, Model for Scale Adaptive River Transport, in Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) to study the impacts of floodplain inundation on land and river processes. We calibrated the river channel geometry and developed a new data-driven inundation scheme to improve the simulation of inundation dynamics in E3SM. The new inundation scheme captures 96% of the spatial variation of inundation area in a satellite inundation product at global scale, in contrast with 7% when the default inundation scheme of E3SM was used. Global simulations including the new inundation scheme performed at (Formula presented.) resolution with and without land-river two-way coupling was used to quantify the impact of coupling. Comparisons show that two-way coupling modifies the water and energy cycle in 20% of the global land cells. Specifically, riverine inundation is reduced by two-way coupling, but inland inundation is intensified. Wetter periods are more impacted by the two-way coupling at the global scale, while regions with different climates exhibit different sensitivities. The two-way exchange of water between the land and river components of E3SM provides the foundation for enabling two-way coupling of land-river sediment and biogeochemical fluxes. These capabilities will be used to improve understanding of the interactions between water and biogeochemical cycles and their response to human perturbations. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {A terrain-based hydrologic model is developed to simulate rivers, lakes,a dn wetlands on the continental scale as a linked dynamical system. this surface water area model (SWAM) is an extension of earlier work [Coe, 1997] and is based on a linear reservoir model. The model requires, as input, estimates of runoff, precipitation, and evaporation from either observations or climate simulations. the model develops its own river transport directions based on elevation. The river discharge is calculated at each grid cell as the accumulated flow of water across the land surface. Lake and wetland area and volume are calculated as a function of the local precipitation minus evaporation, the streamflow into and out of the grid cells, and the potential for storage of water on the surface as derived from 5′×5′ resolution digital terrain models. SWAM is applied on a 5′×5′ spatial resolution to simulate present-day surface waters and river transport for all continents (except Antarctica and Greenland). the model simulates the discharge of the 27 major rivers of the world in fair agreement with the observations; 12 of the rivers have simulated discharge within ±20% of the observational estimates. The discharge from rivers in arid and semi-arid climates is generally overestimated probabnly due to underestimated evaporation from wetlands, irrigated croplands, and reservoirs within the river basins. the modern simulated lake area (about 3% of the land area) is larger than the observed area (about 2% of the land area). Wetlands are poorly simulated by the model due to the coarse vertical and horizontal resolution of the digital terrain models. the model simulates the potential for increased surface water (up to 7.5% of the global land area) and river basin area in semi-arid and arid regions where closed basins exist in the present day climate which illustrates the utility of SWAM for climate change experiments. While higher resolution and more accurate digital terrain models are needed to improve these surface water simulations (particularly for wetlands), these preliminary results indicate that current digital terrain models are adequate for including lakes and rivers as interactive components in the surface hydrology parameterizations of climate models and for studying feedbacks between lakes and climate.},

We quantify nutrient export by large rivers to coastal seas of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, and the associated eutrophication potential in 2000 and 2050. Our new estimates for N and P inputs from human waste are one to two orders of magnitude higher than earlier model calculations.

	abstract = {A ship in a lock chamber is exposed to forces acting on the hull during the filling and emptying processes. These forces accelerate the ship and lead to a displacement. To avoid a collision of the ship with the lock structure, it is moored with mooring lines, which can be strained up to a certain breaking load. The force acting in the mooring lines is called the mooring line force and must be distinguished from the ship force. If the mooring line force exceeds the breaking load, the mooring line will fail and the tension energy will abruptly be transformed into kinetic energy. A snap-back of the mooring line ends can produce great forces and the mooring staff is at risk for major injuries. Furthermore, the ship will start to move and could damage the structure and itself. Thus, the mooring line force must be limited during the locking process. The mooring line force depends on the ship force and, furthermore, on the properties of ship and mooring lines. Due to the number of possible parameter combinations the given ship force alone might not be sufficient to judge on the mooring line safety. In this paper a statistical approach to determine the relations between mooring line configuration, mooring line forces and ship force based on Monte Carlo simulations is shown. © 2023, The Author(s).},

The region is densely populated with limited water resources and vulnerable for water shortages. Study focus: The impact of climate change on salt intrusion in the Albert Canal, the area's major surface water source for drinking water production, is studied. Salt intrusion simulations are conducted by means of a conceptual mass balance model for the canal network combined with a solute transport model for the relevant canal reaches. A 110-year long time series of observed discharge at the upstream boundary is applied to simulate reference conditions for the current climate and is adjusted to account for future climate scenarios. New hydrological insights for the region: Salt water intrusion up to the drinking water inlets is rare under current climate conditions, but its occurrence will increase in the future, up to 1–2 % of the time by 2050, and up to 3–10 % of the time by 2100, for mid- and high-impact climate scenarios, respectively. Chloride concentrations will more often exceed the working limits of water production. These findings illustrate the need for a shift in canal management from the current main focus on inland navigation to a more holistic approach taking climate trends and water quality problems into account. © 2022 The Authors},

The effects of anthropogenic nitrogen discharge on the DIN transport in rivers were studied based on simulations of the period 1991–2010 throughout the entire world, conducted using the developed model, which had a spatial resolution of about 1° for land processes and 0.5° for river transport, and data on fertilizer application, point source pollution, and water use. Our results showed that rivers in western Europe and eastern China were seriously polluted, on average, at a rate of 5,000–15,000 tons per year. In the Yangtze River Basin, the amount of point source pollution in 2010 was about four times more than that in 1991, while the amount of fertilizer used in 2010 doubled, which resulted in the increased riverine DIN levels. Further comparisons suggested that the riverine DIN in the USA was affected primarily by nitrogen fertilizer use, the changes in DIN flow rate in European rivers was dominated by point source pollution, and rivers in China were seriously polluted by both the two pollution sources. The total anthropogenic impact on the DIN exported to the Pacific Ocean has increased from 10% to 30%, more significantly than other oceans. In general, our results indicated that incorporating the schemes of nitrogen transport and human activities into land surface models could be an effective way to monitor global river water quality and diagnose the performance of the land surface modeling. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

	abstract = {River managers intervene in the natural system to increase flood safety, inland shipping or biodiversity by dredging, sediment nourishments or other river engineering works. Complex hydraulic numerical models often form the basis of such decision making. Experience has shown that parameters of these complex models require calibration to increase performance to acceptable levels. However, we hypothesize that implementation of interventions will generally lead to decay in model performance. We used an experimental set-up to quantify this decline in performance due to modelling of levee relocation. Results show performance decay for all calibrated parametersets and an increasing uncertainty as to the predicted effect of the intervention. In closing, we argue that continued model testing and a better understanding of the relationship between reference and modified models might lead to improved model use for river management. Such sustainable model management might be a necessity in sustainable river management. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

	abstract = {One of the main factors of environmental pollution is oil and petroleum products, which annual global emissions resulting from multiple accidents and leaks amount tens of thousands of tons. The problem of oil pollution of water resources has acquired a threatening scope due to a growing offshore oil production and transportation of petroleum products by sea and river transport. An effective way to eliminate the oil pollution of water environments is bioremediation using hydrocarbon-oxidizing microorganisms, in particular actinobacteria of the genus Rhodococcus. We studied the adsorption dynamics of Rhodococcus ruber IEGM 231 cells at the interface between bacterial suspension and liquid hydrocarbon (n-hexadecane or n-dodecane). As a result, mathematical modelling of the initial stage of biofilm formation was performed based on thermodynamic description of cell cluster formation and destruction. The first developed biomechanical model of the surface (interfacial) tension time dependence is phenomenological, it describes the experimental graphs of the corresponding dependence obtained by high-precision tensiometry at different optical densities of bacterial suspensions. The second microlevel model is based on the theory of saturation of the bacterial adsorption layer and the biofilm formation at the hydrocarbon-water interface. In this model, a theoretical explanation of the revealed oscillatory dynamics of interfacial tension is proposed, thus relating to the measuring ring passages through the formed biofilm and the random nature of cell cluster formation-destruction to achieve thermodynamically stable state of the system. © Kuyukina M.S., Feoktistova E.V., Osipenko M.A., Ivshina I.B., Nyashin Yu.I., 2019.},

This case study research is proposing some alternative solutions decreasing negative influences of comparatively declining land transport infrastructure connectivity to the Sea Port hinterland. Analysis of hinterland connectivity is based on the extended gate concept, where a series of terminals and related logistical activities are integrated into a functional single entity. The intensity of real road transport flows on the main connecting road intersections has been evaluated using digital tools with input data from the ArcGIS platform. Also, accessibility to other terminals (at the local, regional and global scale) as well as the terminal is linkage to the regional transport system has been taken into account. One of the objectives of this research was to define objectively the state of traffic flow on the highway connecting Klaipeda sea-port to its hinterland because the road infrastructure was not qualitatively improved for a long period, while the average annual seaport turnover is constantly growing by 6% - 9%. Secondly, it was defined how substantially is possible to decrease the load of road traffic in case of reestablishing of an inland waterway connection between practically the same points of the transport route. Using mathematical modeling of traffic flows is proved that, road transport highway connection in/from the Klaipeda Seaport is loaded substantially and requires systemic improvement (building at least additional lanes in both directions, etc.) to promote further growth of Klaipeda sea-port capacities. The option to apply an additional inland waterway connection allows to decrease the road traffic flow up to 9 - 11% with the possible development of this option, what in its' turn also decrease the negative influence on the environment. © 2020 Silesian University of Technology.

	abstract = {Background, Goal and Scope. The ecoinvent database is a reference work for life cycle inventory data covering the areas of energy, building materials, metals, chemicals, paper and cardboard, forestry, agriculture, detergents, transport services and waste treatment. Generic inventories are available for freight and passenger transport including air, rail, road, and water transport. The goal of freight transport modelling is to provide background data for transport services, which occur between nearly any two process steps of a product system. This paper presents and discusses the model structure, basic assumptions and results for selected freight transport services. Main Features. Transport services are divided into several datasets referred to as transport components. In addition to vehicle operation (comprising vehicle travel and pre-combustion), infrastructure processes such as vehicle maintenance, manufacturing and disposal, as well as transport infrastructure construction, operation and disposal, are also modelled. In order to link the various transport components to the functional unit of one tonne kilometre (tkm), so-called demand factors are determined. In the case of transport infrastructure that is not exclusively used by freight transport, allocation is essential. The respective allocation parameters employed for line infrastructure construction/disposal and operation datasets (including land use) are yearly Gross-tonne kilometre performance (Gtkm) and kilometric vehicle/train performance. Results are presented for selected environmental exchanges related to gaseous emissions (climate change gases, nitrogen oxides, and hydrocarbons), heavy metal (zinc and cadmium) emissions to soil and air, as well as BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand), and land use. Particle emissions are further distinguished into fine (PM2.5) and coarse (diameter between 2.5 and 10 μm) particles. The results presented comprise both an intra- and intermodal comparison. Results and Discussions. A comparison of Swiss and European rail transport reveals considerably lower emissions from Swiss rail transport due to the almost exclusive use of hydropower as traction energy. For gaseous emissions, freight transport by water or rail exhibits considerably better performance than road transport (65-92% less gaseous emissions). As far as zinc and cadmium emissions to soil are concerned, water and rail transport produce less than 1% of the emissions resulting from road transport for either pollutant. For zinc and cadmium emissions to air, road transport has the highest emissions; however, the emissions due to water and rail transport range from 2 to 18% of the emission levels arising from road transport. Particle emissions show a more diverse pattern. Whilst fine particle emissions due to water and rail transport are considerably lower than road transport, rail transport with respect to coarse particles performs worse than road transport. Dominance analysis reveals the importance of infrastructure processes. For instance, the NMHC-emissions of infrastructure processes account for 40%, 30% and 50% of emissions for road, rail and barge transport, respectively. For the demand factor of infrastructure operation, a sensitivity analysis of the employed allocation factor was performed, revealing no sensitivity for gaseous emissions and particles. On the other hand, considerable changes in both emission levels and in the ranking of transport modes is observed for land occupation. Finally, we varied selected operation parameters for road transport, resulting in considerable reductions of CO2 and NOx emissions of up to 60%. In one extreme case (load factor: 100%), NOx emissions for vehicle operation of a lorry are lower than for inland water transport. Only as a result of the considerably higher NOx emissions occurring in infrastructure processes does road transport score worse than water transport, with the ranking remaining the same as for the generic data presented in ecoinvent 2000. Conclusions and Perspectives. The provided datasets allow for a preliminary screening of the importance of transport processes within a product life cycle. In the cases for which transport processes are identified as sensitive for the overall outcome of certain product life cycle or for transport specific comparisons, the modular structure and transparent documentation of demand factors allows for an easy and transparent integration of more case-specific data for selected transport components.},

	abstract = {The Yellow River transports a large amount of sediment and particulate organic carbon (POC), which is thought to mainly derive from erosion of the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). However, the compositions, sources and erosional fluxes of POC in the Yellow River remain poorly constrained. Here we combined measurements of mineralogy, total organic carbon content (OCtotal), stable organic carbon isotopes (δ13Corg), radiocarbon (14C) activity of organic matter in bulk suspended sediments collected seasonally from the upper and middle Yellow River, to quantify the compositions and fluxes of the POC and to assess its sources (biospheric and petrogenic POC, i.e. POCbio and POCpetro, respectively). The results showed that the POC loading of sediments was controlled by mineralogy, grain size and specific surface area of loess particles. The Fmod of POC (0.71 to 0.31) can be explained by mixing of POCpetro with modern and aged POCbio. A binary mixing model based on the hyperbolic relationship of the Fmod and OCtotal revealed a wide range of ages of POCbio from 1300 to 11100 14C years. Relative to the upstream station, the annual POCbio and POCpetro fluxes in the Yellow River are more than doubled after it flows crossing the CLP within 35% drainage area gain, resulting in POCbio and POCpetro yields of the CLP at 3.50 ± 0.59 and 0.48 ± 0.49 tC/km2/yr, respectively. POC flux seasonal variation revealed that monsoon rainfall exerts a first-order control on the export of both POCbio and POCpetro from the CLP to the Yellow River, resulting in more than 90% of the annual POC exported during the monsoon season. Around one third of annual POC erosional flux was transported during a storm event period, highlighting the important role of extreme events in POC export in this large river. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The Mackenzie River is a major freight transportation route that connects many remote communities in the Northwest Territories and parts of Nunavut to southern Canada's transportation network. The river is only navigable during the summer months, from mid-June until sometime in late-September to mid-October, when it is clear of ice. However, the water conditions of the river have changed significantly in recent years. Although water levels always decrease as the delivery season moves into fall, these reductions have been occurring much faster, in turn reducing barge loading capacities as well as operational speeds. In addition, based on simulations of ice breakup and water volumes in the Mackenzie River basin, the sailing season opening dates are anticipated to shift earlier in the future. In the end, the main impact of climate change on river transport is not definitive events but rather, increased variability in events. This research aims to account for those abovementioned climate changes in the freight volume scheduling process, and conducts a numerical analysis based on the projections of future water conditions from climate simulation models as well as predicted freight volumes from time-series analysis and forecast models. The results of the numerical analysis can help local government and waterway transportation companies to better understand how freight scheduling strategies could account for climate changes that affect regional waterway transportation and, hence, optimize their operational schedules to take advantage of good water conditions while reducing financial cost.},

	abstract = {Agricultural nonpoint-source pollution (ANPSP) is a key cause of global environmental problems. However, the estimation of ANPSP, based on agricultural land use type, crop management, and attenuation of pollutants with distance, is lacking. Using the Mun River Basin as an example, this study established quantitative response relationships between subbasin flows and hydrological and water quality parameters. A good matching of the monitored sections and the control area based on flow relationships was achieved. By determining flow paths and flow distances, the overland and in-river transport attenuations of ANPSP were clarified. The overland and in-river transport and attenuation parameters were also quantified. The land use distribution and structure were further refined through crop management, which included crop types and crop rotation (monocropping or double cropping). Based on the above procedures, quantitative relationships among land use pattern, crop management, attenuation of pollutants with distance, and river water quality were established and used to construct six kinds of regression models. Among these models, the best modeling results were obtained when the parameters of water quality, land use structure, crop management, and soil nutrient attenuation were included. The modeling accuracy in the dry season increased from 0.398 to 0.881 when information about attenuation with distance and crop management was included. Similarly, the modeling accuracy in the wet season increased from 0.365 to 0.727.

	abstract = {The Philippines, an archipelago with a population of more than 100 million, is one of the countries most exposed to various natural hazards: seismic hazards and climate-related hazards. In more recent years, significant progress was made in the development of design codes and standards, incorporating hazard mitigation and risk reduction, as well state-of-the-art approach and methodology for seismic analysis and design. These include the National Structural Code of the Philippines (NSCP) in 2015, and the Design Guidelines, Criteria and Standards (DGCS), published also in 2015 by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), the government's engineering agency. Most recently, in January 2018, the Philippine Earthquake Model - a probabilistic seismic hazard analysis of the Philippine archipelago, was published by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology. One of the major infrastructures built in the Philippines are earth dams, which are used for irrigation, hydropower, water supply, inland navigation, mining material storage, and flood control. The safety and resilience of existing dams, as well as new ones, has become a major concern in recent years, considering the occurrences of destructive earthquakes in the past 5-10 years. This paper presents the current state of practice of geotechnical and seismic design of dams in the Philippines. Design codes (both international and local), design methodology, local conditions and area-specific design considerations are presented. The need for reasonably comprehensive geotechnical investigation and site-specific seismic hazard analysis was emphasized. A case study involving the design of a 25-meter high water dam is presented.

	abstract = {The article presents a brief analysis of functioning and development of passenger inland navigation in the functional area of Bydgoszcz and Toruń cities, as one of possible forms of urban ecological recreation. These forms are successfully used in some towns of Western Europe and are additional tourist attractions for visitors and also for the city residents. They offer another form of transport to be used by passengers who travel around the city. The functional area of the analyse towns is considered to be a Metropolitan Area of the Kujawsko-Pomorskie Voivodship and is situated in the central part of Poland. The authors have made a profound analysis of strategic and planning documents for the country and for the analyse area in terms of the passenger water transport development directions. Bydgoszcz-Toruń Functional Area (B-TOF) is characterized by a unique, on a global scale, connection of two water trails, that is, E-40 and E-70 making up the so called Bydgoszcz Water Node which increases tourist attractiveness of the area. Toruń also plays a very important role in the region and is its main tourist attraction. Its historical medieval urban area was entered in 1997 into a List of World Cultural Heritage of UNESCO. Having in mind the results of analysis of the current water passenger transport potential within BTOF it has been found to be worth developing. Extension of water connection in Bydgoszcz has been proposed as well as launching a water tram connection in Toruń. Moreover, a concept of water ways development on the remaining territory of the B-TOF has been presented. The planned water connections require determination of localizations for new water marinas. These localizations depend on the plans of local authorities as well as the infrastructure and territorial conditionings. All new localizations have been precisely characterized in terms of their construction, modernization and maintenance. It was also necessary to make appropriate prognoses of potential passenger currents. The prognoses have been performed for three separate social-economic development scenarios: optimistic, stable and regressive within three timescales, that is, 2020, 2025 and 2030. For this purpose, a simulation transport model, developed by the workers of the Department of Road Engineering and Transport, has been used. The article includes yearly costs of functioning and maintenance of Bydgoszcz and Toruń Water Tram and costs of the planned investments. Also the costs of tourist rest areas construction and maintenance have been calculated. Implementation of the proposed solutions will involve significant financial means. However, this kind of investments do not have to be profitable as they are meant to improve the tourist offer of Bydgoszcz-Toruń Metropolitan Area. They are supposed to improve the image of these towns in terms of ecology, sustainable forms of transport and attractive way of spending leisure time by citizens and visitors. It needs to be mentioned that recently the interest in water transport means has been systematically rising which can contribute to promotion of this ecological form of travel and boost its development. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {The need to balance inland waterway engineering with river ecological integrity has attracted increasing attention from waterway engineers. Quantitative tools for evaluating the effects of waterway engineering on fish habitat serve as an effective basis for engineering design assessment and improvement. A tourism waterway construction project along the Upper Yellow River (UYR) is located within a core area of the National Aquatic Germplasm Resources Conservation Area. The evaluation of the habitat design performance of waterway training works (which is similar to the term of Inland navigation channel training works, it involves structures and measures that reshape a river channel to create reliable depths and widths for safe and dependable vessel transit.), however, are rare in China. To evaluate the effects of waterway engineering on fish habitats and improve engineering design, we evaluated the influence of waterway training works on habitats for endangered adult Platypharodon extremus (Han et al., 2016) by applying a 2D hydrodynamic model to three scenarios: with and without training works and with improved training works. The simulations reproduced changes in flow velocity and water depth within the navigation discharges range. The size and distribution of suitability indexes of water depth and flow velocity and their combined habitat suitability index were employed to assess available habitats for adult Platypharodon extremus to evaluate the influence of engineering actions. The simulations show that the habitat losses due to waterway training works in the study reach can be restored by introducing eco-friendly concepts into training structures and dredging design. Habitat availability for adult Platypharodon extremus has been reduced after waterway training works, especially at low and moderate discharges (the percentage of available area decreased from 13.48% to 11.69% at designed lowest navigation discharge). Habitat availability is much less sensitive to training works at high discharge than at moderate levels. The available habitat can be restored to at least 97% of its original level through the introduction of eco-friendly conceptual designs (the percentage of available area at designed lowest navigation discharge can be recovered to 13.41%). © 2021},

	abstract = {A major shortcoming of the land surface component in climate models is the absence of a river transport algorithm. This issue becomes particularly important in fully coupled climate system models (CSMs), where river transport is required to close and realistically represent the global water cycle. The development of a river-transport algorithm requires knowledge of watersheds and river networks at a scale that is appropriate for use in CSMs. These data must be derived largely from global digital topographic information. The purpose of this paper is to describe a new data set of watersheds and river networks, which is derived primarily from the TerrainBase 5' Global DTM (digital terrain model) and the CIA World Data Bank II. These data serve as a base map for routing continental runoff to the appropriate coast and therefore into the appropriate ocean or inland sea. Using this data set, the runoff produced in any grid cell, when coupled with a routing algorithm, can easily be transported to the appropriate water body and distributed across that water body as desired. The data set includes watershed and flow direction information, as well as supporting hydrologic data at 5', 1/2 °, and 1°resolutions globally. It will be useful in fully coupled land-ocean-atmosphere models, in terrestrial ecosystem models, or in stand-alone macroscale hydrologic-modeling studies.},

We present a mobile-immobile model that incorporates transport as well as immobilization and remobilization of contaminant microbes and other fine particles during baseflow and stormflow. During baseflow conditions, hyporheic exchange flow causes particles to accumulate in streambed sediments. Remobilization of stored particles from streambed sediments occurs slowly during baseflow via hyporheic exchange flow, while remobilization is vastly increased during stormflow. Model predictions are compared to observations over a range of artificial and natural flood events in the dairy contaminated Topehaehae Stream, New Zealand. The model outputs closely matched timing and magnitude of E. coli and turbidity observations through multiple high-flow events. By accounting for both state-of-flow and hyporheic exchange processes, the model provides a valuable framework for predicting particle and contaminant microbe behavior in streams. © 2022.

	abstract = {Inland shipping is pivotal to the comprehensive transport system of China. However, ship emission has become a major air polluter in inland river regions, and relevant emission inventories are urgently needed. Currently, the Automatic identification System based (AIS-based)emission model is widely used in calculating the ocean-going ship emission inventory. However, due to the lack of AIS data in the river area, the inland ship emission inventory mainly uses the fuel consumption method. With the continuous improvement of AIS data quality in the river area, the AIS-based emission model can be adopted in the development of inland ship emission inventory. However, there are few studies on the evaluation of the accuracy of the inland ship emissions using the AIS-based emission model. This study makes a comparison between test data and model-calculated data to evaluate the accuracy of the AIS-based emission models. Inland ship activities are divided into being at berth, maneuvering (port departure and port arrival), and on cruise modes in an AIS-based emission model. The model-calculated CO2, HC, and NOx emission rates can cover those onboard emission test data, but the values from the model are much lower. The total average ratios of test data to model-calculated data for CO2, CO, HC, and NOx are 2.66, 19.12, 2.46, and 3.16 when engine loads are below 60%. In upstream cruise mode, average emission rates of CO2, CO, HC, and NOx from the real-world test are 1.91–6.48, 8.78–27.83, 3.05–8.96, and 4.06–5.96 times higher than those from the AIS-based model, respectively. However, those are only 1.08–1.51, 6.74–9.67, 2.03–3.75, and 1.65–2.75 times higher than those from the AIS-based model in downstream cruise mode. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {River nitrogen export is simulated within the Community Earth System Model (CESM) by coupling nitrogen leaching and runoff fluxes from the Community Land Model (CLM) to the River Transport Model (RTM). The coupled CLM-RTM prognostically simulates the downstream impact of human N cycle perturbation on coastal areas. It also provides a framework for estimating denitrification fluxes of N2 and associated trace gases like N2O in soils and river sediments. An important limitation of the current model is that it only simulates dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) river export, due to the lack of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and particulate nitrogen (PN) leaching fluxes in CLM. In addition, the partitioning of soil N loss in CLM between the primary loss pathways of denitrification and N leaching/runoff appears heavily skewed toward denitrification compared to other literature estimates, especially in nonagricultural regions, and also varies considerably among the four model configurations presented here. River N export is generally well predicted in the model configurations that include midlatitude crops, but tends to be underpredicted in rivers that are less perturbed by human agriculture. This is especially true in the tropics, where CLM likely underestimates leaching and runoff of all forms of nitrogen. River export of DIN is overpredicted in some relatively unperturbed Arctic rivers, which may result from excessive N inputs to those regions in CLM. Better representation of N loss in CLM can improve confidence in model results with respect to the core model objective of simulating nitrogen limitation of the carbon cycle. © 2016 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Climatic changes in the Northern Hemisphere have led to remarkable environmental changes in the Arctic Ocean, which is surrounded by permafrost. These changes include significant shrinking of sea-ice cover in summer, increased time between sea-ice break-up and freeze-up, and Arctic surface water freshening and warming associated with melting sea-ice, thawing permafrost, and increased runoff. These changes are commonly attributed to the greenhouse effect resulting from increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and other non-CO2 radiatively active gases (methane, nitrous oxide). The greenhouse effect should be most pronounced in the Arctic where the largest air CO2 concentrations and winter-summer variations in the world for a clean background environment were detected. However, the air-land-shelf interaction in the Arctic has a substantial impact on the composition of the overlying atmosphere; as the permafrost thaws, a significant amount of old terrestrial carbon becomes available for biogeochemical cycling and oxidation to CO2. The Arctic Ocean's role in determining regional CO2 balance has been ignored, because of its small size (only ∼ 4% of the world ocean area) and because its continuous sea-ice cover is considered to impede gaseous exchange with the atmosphere so efficiently that no global climate models include CO2 exchange over sea-ice. In this paper we show that: (1) the Arctic shelf seas (the Laptev and East-Siberian seas) may become a strong source of atmospheric CO2 because of oxidation of bio-available eroded terrestrial carbon and river transport; (2) the Chukchi Sea shelf exhibits the strong uptake of atmospheric CO2; (3) the sea-ice melt ponds and open brine channels form an important spring/summer air CO2 sink that also must be included in any Arctic regional CO2 budget. Both the direction and amount of CO2 transfer between air and sea during open water season may be different from transfer during freezing and thawing, or during winter when CO2 accumulates beneath Arctic sea-ice; (4) direct measurements beneath the sea ice gave two initial results. First, a drastic pCO2 decrease from 410 μatm to 288 μatm, which was recorded in February-March beneath the fast ice near Barrow using the SAMI-CO2 sensor, may reflect increased photosynthetic activity beneath sea-ice just after polar sunrise. Second, new measurements made in summer 2005 beneath the sea ice in the Central Basin show relatively high values of pCO2 ranging between 425 μatm and 475 μatm, values, which are larger than the mean atmospheric value in the Arctic in summertime. The sources of those high values are supposed to be: high rates of bacterial respiration, import of the Upper Halocline Water (UHW) from the Chukchi Sea (CS) where values of pCO2 range between 400 and 600 μatm, a contribution from the Lena river plume, or any combination of these sources. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Human activities on land have increased the N inputs to rivers and coastal waters worldwide. This increased aquatic emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O). Global, spatially explicit modeling of N flows from land to sea and associated N2O emissions have been developed for a number of decades. During the 1990s, global N2O studies focused to a large extent on closing the global budget. Since then, aquatic emissions of N2O have been subject of scientific discussions. Although it is widely recognized that human activities on land increase aquatic N2O emissions, quantification is difficult because of lack of experimental data. In order to reduce uncertainties, additional long-term studies are required measuring N and N2O concentrations in aquatic systems. More explicit modeling of N2O formation and the underlying biogeochemical cycling in aquatic systems would improve our understanding of aquatic N2O emissions. Global models preferably include both N cycling, N2O production, and river transport in a spatially explicit way, as well as biogeochemical cycling in coastal seas and oceans. Integrative studies are needed that account for the interactions between different impacts of increased levels of reactive N in the environment. We argue that it is still difficult to close the global N2O budget. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Most existing methodologies for investigating transport behaviors are based on physically based numerical models. The pollutant transport trajectory and residence time of Poyang Lake are thought to have important implications for the steadily deteriorating water quality and the associated rapid environmental changes during the flood period. This study used a hydrodynamic model (MIKE 21) in conjunction with transport and particle-tracking sub-models to provide comprehensive investigation of transport behaviors in Poyang Lake. Model simulations reveal that the lake's prevailing water flow patterns cause a unique transport trajectory that primarily develops from the catchment river mouths to the downstream area along the lake's main flow channels, similar to a river-transport behavior. Particle tracking results show that the mean residence time of the lake is 89 days during July-September. The effect of the Yangtze River (the effluent of the lake) on the residence time is stronger than that of the catchment river inflows. The current study represents a first attempt to use a combined model approach to provide insights into the transport behaviors for a large river-lake system, given proposals to manage the pollutant inputs both directly to the lake and catchment rivers. © 2015 by the authors.},

	abstract = {A ship performance model is an important factor in energy-efficient navigation. It formulates a speed–power relationship that can be used to adjust the engine loads for dynamic energy optimisation. However, currently available models have been developed for sea-going vessels, where the environmental conditions are significantly different from those experienced on inland waterways. Inland waterway shipping has great potential to become a mode of transport that can both improve safety and reduce emissions. Therefore, this paper presents the development of an energy performance model specifically for inland waterway vessels (IWVs). The holistic ship energy system model is based on empirical methods, from resistance to engine performance prediction, established in a modular code architecture. The resistance and propulsion prediction in confined waterways are captured by a newly developed method, considering a superposing of shallow water and bank effect. Verification against model tests and high-fidelity simulations indicate that the selected empirical methods achieved good accuracy for predicting ship performance. The resistance prediction error was 5.2% for single vessels and 8% for pusher-barge convoys based on empirical methods. The results of a case study investigating the performance of a self-propelled vessel under dynamic waterway data, indicate that the developed model could be used for onboard power monitoring and energy optimisation during operation. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Focusing on coastal or inland navigation cities, where emissions from ships are not negligible concerning global ones, the possibility of reducing exhaust gas pollution would have more benefits for public health and air quality. Therefore, in recent years, increasing attention on environmental sustainability is driving the shipbuilding industry towards greener propulsion based on full-electric or hybrid-electric propulsion systems. This work is presented a parallel hybrid system composed of two electric motors, one internal combustion engine, and lithium battery storage. All motors are coupled to the propeller through a specially designed transmission system based on the High Sliding Gear theory (HSG). The hybrid-electric propulsion system is designed to extender the battery pack durability, ensuring a smooth profile of the required current, through the complementary action of the batteries and the internal combustion engine. Then, the overall performance of the hybrid propulsion system is verified by laboratory experimentations, also testing the energy storage system. A fast boat (yacht) is chosen as a simulation case where a lumped parameters model is coupled with map-based motors obtained from experimental test activities performed on this hybrid propulsion system. This model is also validated by the available performance data obtained during an experimental campaign where has been emulated a typical propeller load. The results show the feasibility of this hybrid architecture, in terms of performance and sustainable maritime transport. Furthermore, the simulation results confirm the experimental performance, proving to be a good tool for system development in terms of energy management.  © 2023 SAE International.

	abstract = {Inland waterways are large-scale networks used principally for navigation. Even if the transport planning is an important issue, the water resource management is a crucial point. Indeed, navigation is not possible when there is too little or too much water inside the waterways. Hence, the water resource management of waterways has to be particularly efficient in a context of climate change and increase of water demand. This management has to be done by considering different time and space scales and still requires the development of new methodologies and tools in the topics of the Control and Informatics communities. This work addresses the problem of waterways management in terms of modeling, control, diagnosis and fault-tolerant control by focusing in the inland waterways of the north of France.

	abstract = {In the framework of inland navigation, the loss of water in a reach due to lockages has to be counterbalanced. The water may be pumped from the lower reach but this supply is energy consuming. In order to reduce the amount of water to be pumped, water may come from tributary streams by gravity. In the case of the Canal du Centre, a stream called "La Haine" may be partially diverted into the Canal du Centre, through a by-channel arriving downstream of the lock in Obourg, a city in the area of Mons in Belgium. However, this stream carries a large amount of suspended materials. It does exist a settling basin between the by-channel and the Canal du Centre to diminish the sediment supply in the canal. But at present, the by-channel is blocked. The Walloon administration would like to reuse it because the fluvial transport is expected to increase in the near future and because a new center for gathering the mud has been set up next to the channel. In this paper, the efficiency of the settling basin is analysed to help deciding whether the settling basin should be reused or not. The impact of the discharge flowing in the basin on the efficiency is accounted for in the analysis. The study is made of a measurement campaign and numerical modeling. The results of both methods are compared. The by-channel has been opened so that field measurements could be undertaken. A suspended-load sampler and a pressure gauge were set in two locations: (1) upstream of the by-channel and (2) downstream of the settling basin. They allow the sediment concentration and the water level to be measured. The water discharge is deduced from the known head on the downstream weir. The amount of deposited sediments is then deducted. This measurement campaigns shows that, even during peak flow, the concentration in sediments is highly decreased due to the settling basin. A numerical model has been designed by the Hydraulics Research Laboratory in Châtelet, Belgium. The model computes the distance crossed by the particles during a steady flow, knowing the time evolution of the water discharge and the sediment concentration at the entry of the basin. It accounts for the fall velocity of the sediments sampled in situ. For the median diameter of 16.10 μm, the settling velocity is 0.205 mm/s according to the Stokes' law. The model shows that the water discharge that ensures an efficient settling is 1 m3/s. It also computes the volume of the deposited sediments. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

	abstract = {Realistically representing spatial heterogeneity and lateral land surface processes within and between modeling units in Earth system models is important because of their implications to surface energy and water exchanges. The traditional approach of using regular grids as computational units in land surface models may lead to inadequate representation of subgrid heterogeneity and lateral movements of water, energy and carbon fluxes. Here a subbasin-based framework is introduced in the Community Land Model (CLM), which is the land component of the Community Earth System Model (CESM). Local processes are represented in each subbasin on a pseudo-grid matrix with no significant modifications to the existing CLM modeling structure. Lateral routing of water within and between subbasins is simulated with the subbasin version of a recently developed physically based routing model, Model for Scale Adaptive River Transport (MOSART). The framework is implemented in two topographically and climatically contrasting regions of the US: the Pacific Northwest and the Midwest. The relative merits of this modeling framework, with greater emphasis on scalability (i.e., ability to perform consistently across spatial resolutions) in streamflow simulation compared to the grid-based modeling framework are investigated by performing simulations at 0.125°, 0.25°, 0.5°, and 1° spatial resolutions. Comparison of the two frameworks at the finest spatial resolution showed that a small difference between the averaged forcing could lead to a larger difference in the simulated runoff and streamflow because of nonlinear processes. More systematic comparisons conducted using statistical metrics calculated between each coarse resolution and the corresponding 0.125°-resolution simulations showed superior scalability in simulating both peak and mean streamflow for the subbasin based over the grid-based modeling framework. Scalability advantages are driven by a combination of improved consistency in runoff generation and the routing processes across spatial resolutions. © 2014 Author(s).},

	abstract = {The availability of supporting bunker infrastructure for zero-emission energy sources will be key to accommodate zero-emission inland waterway transport (IWT). However, it remains unclear which (mix of) zero-emission energy sources to prepare for, and how to plan the bunker infrastructure in relative positions and required capacity at corridor scale. To provide insight into the positioning and dimensions of bunkering infrastructure we propose a bottom-up energy consumption method combined with agent based network simulation. In the method, we first produce a two-way traffic energy consumption map, aggregated from the energy footprint of individual vessels on the transport network. Next we investigate the potential sailing range of the vessels on the network if they would sail the same routes, but with alternative energy carriers. Based on the sailing range of the vessels for different energy carriers, the maximum inter-distance between refuelling points can be estimated. By aggregating the energy consumptions of all the vessels on the network, we can estimate the required capacity of a given refuelling point. To demonstrate the basic functionality we implement the method to four representative corridor scale inland shipping examples using zero-emission energy sources including hydrogen, batteries, e-NH3, e-methanol and e-LNG. The application in this paper is limited to four abstract cases. A recommended next step is to apply this approach to a more realistic network. © 2023, The Author(s).},

This paper aims to assess the economy and CO2 emission reduction of LNG-fuelled ships on inland waterway transportation, under the context that the uniqueness of inland waterway transportation, as well as cargo transportation regulations and policies are taken into account. Firstly, considering the preferential policies for LNG-fuelled ships and the mandatory use of shore power for oil-fuelled ships, we proposed a fuel consumption calculation formula and established economic and emission assessment models for inland ships. Then, we examined these models with simulation examples of three main cargo types, i.e. dry bulk, containers and dangerous goods, transported on the Yangtze River. The optimal ranges of LNG-fuelled ship size were given under various credible scenarios designed according to the transportation systems. The results show: (1) The optimal range of dead-weight tonnage (DWT) of LNG-fuelled ships for dry bulk, container and dangerous goods are between 3,000–5,000 DWT, 3,000–4,000 DWT and 2,000–3,000 DWT, respectively. (2) LNG-fuelled dry bulk ships of about 10,000 DWT or more are uneconomical compared to oil-fuelled ships of the same tonnage. (3) Smaller LNG-fuelled ships, such as dry bulk ships of less than 1,500 DWT, container and dangerous goods ships of less than 2,000 DWT, or ships serving longer routes of approximately more than 1,000 km have most significant unit CO2 emission reduction than oil-fuelled ships of the same tonnage. (4) Excessive waiting time at locks will reduce the economic feasibility and unit CO2 emission reduction of LNG-fuelled ships. Finally, we obtained a series of important management significances by simulating the changes of some variable parameters in real situations. These conclusions can provide some theoretical foundations for the development of LNG-fuelled or other green ships in inland waterways, and guide the government in formulating policies to promote the green transformation of the inland shipping industry. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The land-surface model of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS-LSM), which includes lateral flow, water use, nitrogen discharge and river transport, soil freeze-thaw front dynamics, and urban planning, was implemented in the Flexible Global Ocean-Atmosphere-Land System model, grid-point version 3 (CAS-FGOALS-g3) to investigate the climatic effects of eco-hydrological processes and human activities. Simulations were conducted using the land-atmospheric component setup of CAS-FGOALS-g3 with given sea-surface temperatures and sea-ice distributions to assess its new capabilities. It was shown that anthropogenic groundwater use led to increased latent heat flux of about 20 W∙m−2 in three groundwater overexploitation areas: North India, northern China, and central United States. The groundwater lateral flow accompanied by this exploitation has led to deepening water table depth in these regions. The derived permafrost extent from the soil freeze-thaw front (FTF) was comparable to observations, and the inclusion of FTF dynamics enabled simulations of seasonal variations in freeze-thaw processes and related eco-hydrological effects. Inclusion of riverine nitrogen transport and its joint implementation with the human activity scheme showed large dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations in major rivers around the globe, including western Europe, eastern China, and the U.S. Midwest, which were affected by nitrogen retention and surface water use during transport. The results suggest that the model is a useful tool for studying the effects of land-surface processes on global climate, especially those influenced by human interventions. © 2020. The Authors.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a multiple linear regression model developed for describing global river export of sediments (suspended solids, TSS) to coastal seas, and approaches for estimating organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous transported as particulate matter (POC, PN, and PP) associated with sediments. The model, with river-basin spatial scale and a 1-year temporal scale, is based on five factors with a significant influence on TSS yields (the extent of marginal grassland and wetland rice, Fournier precipitation, Fournier slope, and lithology), and accounts for sediment trapping in reservoirs. The model generates predictions within a factor of 4 for 80% of the 124 rivers in the data set. It is a robust model which was cross-validated by using training and validation sets of data, and validated against independent data. In addition, Monte Carlo simulations were used to deal with uncertainties in the model coefficients for the five model factors. The global river export of TSS calculated thus is 19 Pg yr-1 with a 95% confidence interval of 11-27 Pg yr-1 when accounting for sediment trapping in regulated rivers. Associated POC, PN, and PP export is 197 Tg yr-1 (as C), 30 Tg yr-1 (N), and 9 Tg yr-1 (P), respectively. The global sediment trapping included in these estimates is 13%. Most particulate nutrients are transported by rivers to the Pacific (∼37% of global particulate nutrient export), Atlantic (28-29%), and Indian (∼20%) oceans, and the major source regions are Asia (∼50% of global particulate nutrient export), South America (∼20%), and Africa (12%).

The model is coupled with the Model for Scale Adaptive River Transport (MOSART) that represents river routing and a water management model (WM) that represents the effects of reservoir operations and water withdrawals on flow regulation. The coupled models allow the impacts of reservoir operations and withdrawals on stream temperature to be explicitly represented in a physically based and consistent way. The models have been applied to the Contiguous United States driven by observed meteorological forcing. Including water management in the models improves the agreement between the simulated and observed streamflow at a large number of stream gauge stations. It is then shown that the model is capable of reproducing stream temperature spatiotemporal variation satisfactorily by comparing against the observed data from over 320 USGS stations. Both climate and water management are found to have important influence on the spatiotemporal patterns of stream temperature. Furthermore, it is quantitatively estimated that reservoir operation could cool down stream temperature in the summer low-flow season (August-October) by as much as 1a14 2C due to enhanced low-flow conditions, which have important implications to aquatic ecosystems. Sensitivity of the simulated stream temperature to input data and reservoir operation rules used in the WM model motivates future directions to address some limitations in the current modeling framework. © 2015.

	abstract = {The influence of shipping emissions on the air quality in European port cities was studied using the chemical transport model LOTOS-EUROS. Using the model’s source apportionment capabilities, the contribution of international and inland shipping emissions to atmospheric air pollutant concentrations in 19 European port cities was computed. The shipping emission on seas was derived from Automatic Identification System data of all ships sailing in the total geographic domain of the calculations. These emissions are higher than the emissions reported to the European Environment Agency as a result of the restrictive definition of maritime emissions in the national inventories of the EU Member States which do not include any shipping emission outside the territorial waters of the Member States. The total European NOx emissions used in this simulation were ~9.3 Mton for the simulation domain of which 64 kton (0.7%) originates from inland shipping and 2.2 Mton (23%) originates from international shipping emissions. Locally, shipping emissions contributed significantly to atmospheric pollutant concentrations in areas around big ports and port cities. For example, in the Rijnmond region around Rotterdam almost 30% of the NO2 annual mean concentration in 2018 originates from a combination of international and inland shipping emissions. For all the port cities examined, the relative contribution from international shipping was 22% on average, while the contribution was 28% on average when only sea ports are taken into account. This showed the significance of emissions from shipping on the local air quality in cities around big ports in Europe and indicated that mitigation policies aimed at reducing emissions from shipping can be effective for improving the air quality in port-cities.},

As more attention is paid to microplastics, an emerging contaminant in waterways worldwide, and how they move along rivers, whether microplastic particles also accumulate behind dams is an important question for informing estimates of global river inputs to oceans. In this study, we measured microplastic concentrations above, below, and within the reservoirs of six dams near Ithaca, NY USA. Samples were processed following the wet peroxide oxidation method and visual counting, followed by Raman Spectroscopy validation. We found that microplastic concentrations in sediment within reservoirs was significantly higher than in sediment above the dams (p = 0.005), and in water samples, concentrations within reservoirs was significantly lower (p = 0.02). Plastic fibers were the dominant plastic type, but in within-reservoir sediment samples, less abundant plastic types such as plastic fragments were found in higher proportions. These results show that the sediment collecting behind dams is one sink for microplastics in river systems at long timescales, indicating that accounting for dams may be important when modeling global riverine microplastic transport. © 2019},

	abstract = {Barge transport operations on the Mackenzie River, a major transportation corridor in the Northwest Territories, are impacted by multiple sources of uncertainties. In particular, the impacts of climate change on this important corridor have led to summer shipping seasons that are growing more volatile in terms of length and quality. This change can lead to a growing reliance on costly airlifts for delivering essential freight that cannot be delivered by barge during seasons that end early due to low water. The Government of Northwest Territories has been planning the construction of the Mackenzie Valley Highway (MVH) for decades to provide cheaper, more reliable transportation for communities. However, the costs of constructing the MVH are prohibitive, and traditional benefit-cost analyses are unable to consider flexible investment actions in response to uncertainties. Therefore, we apply a real options modeling framework to determine if and when to construct the different segments of the MVH, considering climate change and freight demand uncertainties. We first model climate and freight demand uncertainties as geometric Brownian motion processes. Next, a benefit-cost model is developed. Finally, we use the least-squares Monte Carlo method to solve for extended project values and optimal investment times for each segment. The results indicate that Segment 2 has the largest value with an optimal seven-year delay in investment time, followed by Segment 1, Segment 3, and Segment 4 in the last year of the planning period (or possibly beyond). Freight demand volatility appears to have the greatest impact on project values and investment years. The results show that, although the benefits of construction may not outweigh the costs now, they may at some future date; in between, decision makers have opportunities to change their minds as conditions change. This is particularly important in northern Canada, where highly costly infrastructure investment decisions are subject to massive uncertainties. Overall, we see such an approach as a tool to communicate the value of uncertainty in infrastructure benefit-cost analyses and as one tool in a larger decision-support toolbox that is required for major transportation investments in northern Canada. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {Dramatic environmental shifts are occuring throughout the Arctic from climate change, with consequences for the cycling of mercury (Hg). This review summarizes the latest science on how climate change is influencing Hg transport and biogeochemical cycling in Arctic terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. As environmental changes in the Arctic continue to accelerate, a clearer picture is emerging of the profound shifts in the climate and cryosphere, and their connections to Hg cycling. Modeling results suggest climate influences seasonal and interannual variability of atmospheric Hg deposition. The clearest evidence of current climate change effects is for Hg transport from terrestrial catchments, where widespread permafrost thaw, glacier melt and coastal erosion are increasing the export of Hg to downstream environments. Recent estimates suggest Arctic permafrost is a large global reservoir of Hg, which is vulnerable to degradation with climate warming, although the fate of permafrost soil Hg is unclear. The increasing development of thermokarst features, the formation and expansion of thaw lakes, and increased soil erosion in terrestrial landscapes are increasing river transport of particulate-bound Hg and altering conditions for aquatic Hg transformations. Greater organic matter transport may also be influencing the downstream transport and fate of Hg. More severe and frequent wildfires within the Arctic and across boreal regions may be contributing to the atmospheric pool of Hg. Climate change influences on Hg biogeochemical cycling remain poorly understood. Seasonal evasion and retention of inorganic Hg may be altered by reduced sea-ice cover and higher chloride content in snow. Experimental evidence indicates warmer temperatures enhance methylmercury production in ocean and lake sediments as well as in tundra soils. Improved geographic coverage of measurements and modeling approaches are needed to better evaluate net effects of climate change and long-term implications for Hg contamination in the Arctic. © 2022 The Authors},

The results of a 350-year CCSM2 control simulation were compared to observational river flow data and previous simulations using the Community Climate Model, version 3 (CCM3). River discharge into the Arctic Ocean improved significantly over earlier CCM3 simulations. Significant interannual variability was evident in the control simulation, although at times it exceeded the observational variability. The CCSM2 river discharges to the ocean during the peak discharge month of June for the Amazon, Amur, Ob, St. Lawrence, and Ganges Rivers were found to be within 25% of observations. CCSM2 produced negative river discharges for the St. Lawrence, Parana, and Ob Rivers for some months of the year because of the methods CCSM2 used to calculate runoff resulting from lakes, wetlands, and glaciers. Precipitation and snow cover analyses explained some of the improvements of CCSM2 over CCM3 as well as lingering sources of inaccuracy in the river discharges. The lack of water impoundment in both CCSM2 and CCM3 was shown to be another source of discrepancy between model river discharge and observed streamgage data. We discuss the differences and similarities between CCSM2 river discharges and observations within the context of extant freshwater resource management, observational measurement techniques, and spatial and temporal scales.

	abstract = {The International Commission for the Hydrology of the Rhine basin (CHR) has carried out a research project to assess the impact of climate change on the river flow conditions in the Rhine basin. Along a bottom-up line, different detailed hydrological models with hourly and daily time steps have been developed for representative sub-catchments of the Rhine basin. Along a topdown line, a water balance model for the entire Rhine basin has been developed, which calculates monthly discharges and which was tested on the scale of the major tributaries of the Rhine. Using this set of models, the effects of climate change on the discharge regime in different parts of the Rhine basin were calculated using the results of UKHI and XCCC GCM-experiments. All models indicate the same trends in the changes: higher winter discharge as a result of intensified snow-melt and increased winter precipitation, and lower summer discharge due to the reduced winter snow storage and an increase of evapotranspiration. When the results are considered in more detail, however, several differences show up. These can firstly be attributed to different physical characteristics of the studied areas, but different spatial and temporal scales used in the modelling and different representations of several hydrological processes (e.g., evapotranspiration, snow melt) are responsible for the differences found as well. Climate change can affect various socio-economic sectors. Higher temperatures may threaten winter tourism in the lower winter sport areas. The hydrological changes will increase flood risk during winter, whilst low flows during summer will adversely affect inland navigation, and reduce water availability for agriculture and industry. Balancing the required actions against economic cost and the existing uncertainties in the climate change scenarios, a policy of 'no-regret and flexibility' in water management planning and design is recommended, where anticipatory adaptive measures in response to climate change impacts are undertaken in combination with ongoing activities.},

	abstract = {Coastal backwater effects are caused by the downstream water level increase as a result of elevated sea level, high river discharge and their compounding influence. Such effects have crucial impacts on floods in densely populated regions but have not been well represented in large-scale river models used in Earth system models (ESMs), partly due to model mesh deficiency and oversimplifications of river hydrodynamics. Using two mid-Atlantic river basins as a testbed, we perform the first attempt to simulate the backwater effects comprehensively over a coastal region using the MOSART river transport model under an ESM framework, i.e., Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) configured on a regionally refined unstructured mesh, with a focus on understanding the backwater drivers and their long-term variations. By including sea level variations at the river downstream boundary, the model performance in capturing backwaters is greatly improved. We also propose a new flood event selection scheme to facilitate the decomposition of backwater drivers into different components. Our results show that while storm surge is a key driver, the influence of extreme discharge cannot be neglected, particularly when the river drains to a narrow river-like estuary. Compound flooding, while not necessarily increasing the flood peaks, exacerbates the flood risk by extending the duration of multiple coastal and fluvial processes. Furthermore, our simulations and analysis highlight the increasing strength of backwater effects due to sea level rise and more frequent storm surge during 1990-2019. Thus, backwaters need to be properly represented in ESMs to improve the predictive understanding of coastal flooding.  Copyright © 2022 Dongyu Feng et al.},

	abstract = {Quantifying the transport of plastic debris from river to sea is crucial for assessing the risks of plastic debris to human health and the environment. We present a global modelling approach to analyse the composition and quantity of point-source microplastic fluxes from European rivers to the sea. The model accounts for different types and sources of microplastics entering river systems via point sources. We combine information on these sources with information on sewage management and plastic retention during river transport for the largest European rivers. Sources of microplastics include personal care products, laundry, household dust and tyre and road wear particles (TRWP). Most of the modelled microplastics exported by rivers to seas are synthetic polymers from TRWP (42%) and plastic-based textiles abraded during laundry (29%). Smaller sources are synthetic polymers and plastic fibres in household dust (19%) and microbeads in personal care products (10%). Microplastic export differs largely among European rivers, as a result of differences in socio-economic development and technological status of sewage treatment facilities. About two-thirds of the microplastics modelled in this study flow into the Mediterranean and Black Sea. This can be explained by the relatively low microplastic removal efficiency of sewage treatment plants in the river basins draining into these two seas. Sewage treatment is generally more efficient in river basins draining into the North Sea, the Baltic Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. We use our model to explore future trends up to the year 2050. Our scenarios indicate that in the future river export of microplastics may increase in some river basins, but decrease in others. Remarkably, for many basins we calculate a reduction in river export of microplastics from point-sources, mainly due to an anticipated improvement in sewage treatment. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Recent studies of sediment dynamics and clinoform development in the northern Adriatic Sea focused on winter 2002-2003 and provided the data and motivation for development of a detailed sediment-transport model for the area near the Po River delta. We used both idealized test cases and more realistic simulations to improve our understanding of seasonal sediment dynamics there. We also investigated the relationship between physical processes and the observed depositional products; e.g. the accumulation of sediment very near the Po River distributary mouths. Sediment transport near the Po River was evaluated using a three-dimensional ocean model coupled to sediment-transport calculations that included wave- and current-induced resuspension, suspended-sediment transport, multiple grain classes, and fluvial input from the Po River. High-resolution estimates from available meteorological and wave models were used to specify wind, wave, and meteorological forcing. Model results indicated that more than half of the discharged sediment remained within 15 km of the Po River distributary mouths, even after two months of intensive reworking by winter storms. During floods of the Po River, transport in the middle to upper water column dominated sediment fluxes. Otherwise, sediment fluxes from the subaqueous portion of the delta were confined to the bottom few meters of the water column, and correlated with increases in current speed and wave energy. Spatial and temporal variation in wind velocities determined depositional patterns and the directions of sediment transport. Northeasterly Bora winds produced relatively more eastward transport, while southwesterly Sirocco winds generated fluxes towards both the north and the south. Eastward transport accounted for the majority of the sediment exported from the subaqueous delta, most likely due to the frequent occurrence of Bora conditions. Progradation of the Po River delta into the Adriatic Sea may restrict the formation of the Western Adriatic Coastal Current, increasing sediment retention at the Po delta and reducing the supply of sediment to the Apennine margin. A positive morphodynamic feedback may therefore be present whereby the extension of the delta into the Adriatic increases sediment accumulation at the delta and facilitates further progradation. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic water regulation activities, including reservoir interception, surface water withdrawal, and groundwater extraction, alter riverine hydrologic processes and affect dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export from land to rivers and oceans. In this study, schemes describing soil DOC leaching, riverine DOC transport, and anthropogenic water regulation were developed and incorporated into the Community Land Model 5.0 (CLM5.0) and the River Transport Model (RTM). Three simulations by the developed model were conducted on a global scale from 1981-2013 to investigate the impacts of anthropogenic water regulation on riverine DOC transport. The validation results showed that DOC exports simulated by the developed model were in good agreement with global river observations. The simulations showed that DOC transport in most rivers was mainly influenced by reservoir interception and surface water withdrawal, especially in central North America and eastern China. Four major rivers, including the Danube, Yangtze, Mississippi, and Ganges rivers, have experienced reduced riverine DOC flows due to intense water management, with the largest effect occurring in winter and early spring. In the Danube and Yangtze river basins, the impact in 2013 was 4 to 5 times greater than in 1981, with a retention efficiency of over 50%. The Ob river basin was almost unaffected.

	abstract = {A model of deforming sediment is added to a climate-ice sheet model, and applied to the Eocene-Oligocene transition in Antarctic ice volume around 34 Ma. The coupling between the global climate and ice sheet models is asynchronous, with a climate simulation performed once every 10 000 years, and only for the first 40 000 years. These global climate model solutions are re-used to perform runs of 400 000 years in length, with orbital forcing and different levels of CO2. The sediment model includes bulk transport under ice, generation of sub-ice till, and river transport, and predicts the continental-scale evolution of sediment thickness and coastal discharge. For the first few 10 000's of years after the onset of substantial ice (triggered by CO2 falling below ∼ 3 X pre-industrial level), sediment discharge to the ocean is relatively uniform around the coast, derived from nearby pre-existing regolith. After that, most discharge is concentrated into ∼ 4 sites at the mouths of major trough systems, with orbitally paced pulses on 104-yr scales. These sites and the average magnitudes of the fluxes agree generally with those deduced from offshore seismic and core data, although longer (10 my) integrations are needed to model the real sediment evolution. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {As a global persistent organic pollutant, perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) have aroused great public concern. However, little is known regarding the effect of ship navigation disturbance on the transport and fate of PFAAs in inland waterways developed regions. In the present study, overlying water, pore water, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and sediment were collected from waterways (WWs), non-navigable channels (NCs), and ports (PTs) in Taihu Lake Basin. The results revealed that the total concentrations of PFAAs (ΣPFAAs) in WWs, NCs, and PTs varied considerably in different media. In overlying water, the mean ΣPFAAs in WWs were the highest, while those of NCs were relatively higher in the remaining three media. A comparison of PFAA distribution coefficients revealed that the values in NCs were generally higher than those of WWs and PTs, suggesting the critical role of ship navigation in PFAA transport. Furthermore, a structural equation model was applied to estimate direct and indirect effects of environmental factors on PFAA partitioning behavior. The results revealed that ship traffic volume (STV) exerted indirect effects on PFAA distribution between solid and dissolved phases by influencing dissolved oxygen, total suspended solid concentration, clay and sand contents, and median diameter. PFAAs were more readily to be released into overlying water from pore water than in sediment, and the ΣPFAAs carried per gram of SPM decreased with an increase in STV. Ecological risk assessment and Monte Carlo simulation results revealed that ship navigation could exert adverse effects on aquatic organisms, making the average probability of RQmix values to exceed corresponding risk values in WWs, which were 1.3–2-fold higher than in NCs. The present study provides crucial information for simulating the environmental behaviors of PFAAs under the influence of ship navigation and is significant for the integration of inland water transport development and aquatic environmental protection. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Using calculations based on the marine carbon system and on modelling, the sensitivity of Baltic Sea surface pH was examined. Transient long-term calculations demonstrated that the marine carbon system adjusts to lateral boundary conditions within some decades, as does salinity. Climate changes in temperature or salinity will only marginally affect the acid-base (pH) balance. Wetter or dryer climate will also play a minor role in the pH balance. The direct effect on seawater pH of acid precipitation over the Baltic Sea surface was demonstrated to be small. Acidification due to river transport of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into the marine system seems marginal although mineralization of terrestrial DOC may cause extra marine acidification, but the effect has yet to be quantified. Increased nutrient load may increase the amplitude in the pH seasonal cycle and increase the acidification during winter time. Fossil fuel burning is likely to have both a direct and indirect effect through increased CO2 levels, altering seawater pH as well as changing the river chemistry. This may severely threaten some species in the Baltic Sea, particularly in the Northern Baltic. © 2010 The Authors Journal compilation © 2010 Blackwell Munksgaard.},

	abstract = {During the last two decades several integrated tools have been developed to make the existing scientific knowledge available to river managers and assist them with the formulation and evaluation of alternative combinations of measures. Yet, few practical examples of embedding of these instruments in river management organizations can be observed so far. This paper identifies the possible organizational, technical, and scientific factors that may form an obstacle for the design and application of a Decision-Support System (DSS) for river-basin management by analyzing the interaction between the different participants in the Elbe DSS project. In particular attention is paid to the software engineering aspects of the design process. In order to start an integrated approach to deal with conflicting river strategies a project to develop a prototype tool for integrated management of the Elbe catchment was initiated, which includes functionalities related to inland navigation, water quality, flood safety, and vegetation ecology. The problems faced in the German part of the Elbe catchment range from poor navigation conditions and flooding vulnerability to a need to restore and maintain the natural state of the floodplains. Several river engineering works such as large-scale dike shifting, channel dredging, and large-scale retention are in a planning or implementation stage. From the beginning of the project onwards attention was paid to the involvement of potential end-users and key stakeholders in the design process. The experience of the project is that internal consistency of models and data, effective communication, and functional flexibility are essential to warrant a proper balance between scientific standards, the availability of models, and the requirements of users. This facilitates the design process and improves the chance of successful implementation. © The Author(s) 2008.},

	abstract = {A modeling attempt is presented to describe the global carbon and nitrogen cycle: where it originates, where it stays, and how the global carbon and nitrogen budgets can be balanced. We used integrated but simple box models: a coupled global carbon-nitrogen cycle and climate model. The global carbon-nitrogen cycle model describes on a global scale the exchange fluxes between the compartments and their main internal processes and different biogeochemical feedbacks (e.g., for Co2 and N fertilization and for temperature). The coupled model also includes an energy balance climate model, using as input the induced radiative forcing of greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols. Simulation experiments performed with the coupled model showed that by incorporating only the CO2 fertilization and temperature- related feedbacks a balanced past carbon budget could not be created. Therefore the N fertilization of the anthropogenic nitrogen depositions for temperate forests, which depends on the fate of the anthropogenic nitrogen inputs, must be included. By varying the N fluxes by river transport, and deposition and denitrification, a balanced past nitrogen budget was obtained. This resulted in an anthropogenic deposition of 40 Tg N yr-1 for the temperate forests and a N fertilization which constitutes 20-50 of the missing carbon sink. Finally, the future fate of anthropogenic emissions of the C and mobilization of the N compounds were projected given the condition of balanced carbon and nitrogen budgets.
